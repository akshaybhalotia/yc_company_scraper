And our software tool for suppliers helps businesses to deal with all the pain points of growing customer database, from ordering to payments.\r\n\r\nWith our data-driven approach, we connects local, independent retailers with the right brands, distributors, and wholesalers to stock their store with the best products. This saves retailers and suppliers time and money, allowing them to focus on what's most important: building and running their business.\r\n\r\nborong is headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"borong is a SaaS-enabled marketplace that connects brands like…","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Marketplace","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"SaaS","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"B2B","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":13519,"name":"Recall.ai","slug":"recall-ai","former_names":["Hyperdoc","Perfect Recall"],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/2d6872d13351da06ebec7a2375682212667cb787.png","website":"https://www.recall.ai","all_locations":"San Francisco, CA, USA; Waterloo, ON, Canada; Remote","long_description":"Recall is the universal API for meeting bots.

With Spenny, they just connect the card and invest every time they spend.\r\n\r\nWe're growing 67% WoW since launch, with 3,000+ users and $15,000 in AUM. Indians put $500Bn into their bank accounts annually. We charge 1.75% of the AUM for investments. That's a direct ~$9Bn market in India alone.\r\n\r\nPotentially every time a user makes a transaction, we make money. And in that sense, the timing for Spenny couldn't have been better: 1 Trillion+ transactions are expected in 2021 because of factors like Whatsapp launching its P2P payments in India for its 400M users. And the emergence of UPI means every Indian has a virtual bank account now. \r\n\r\nMore interesting revenue models develop from the transaction data insights of our users.

Every time a user make any digital transaction, we round off the amount to the nearest 10 INR and invest it for them into a diversified portfolio, automatically.\r\n\r\n400M millennials in India don't invest because they don't have enough time, knowledge or access to large capital. With Spenny, they just connect the card and invest every time they spend.\r\n\r\nWe're growing 67% WoW since launch, with 3,000+ users and $15,000 in AUM. Indians put $500Bn into their bank accounts annually. We charge 1.75% of the AUM for investments. That's a direct ~$9Bn market in India alone.\r\n\r\nPotentially every time a user makes a transaction, we make money. And in that sense, the timing for Spenny couldn't have been better: 1 Trillion+ transactions are expected in 2021 because of factors like Whatsapp launching its P2P payments in India for its 400M users. And the emergence of UPI means every Indian has a virtual bank account now. \r\n\r\nMore interesting revenue models develop from the transaction data insights of our users.

Antibodies are a growing class of drugs that have tremendous safety and efficacy advantages over small molecules; 7 of the top 10 selling drugs are antibodies, earning an average of $7B in revenue. However, antibodies- especially ones that activate and modulate cell surface receptors- are hard to find.

Thanks to our software solutions, we have been able to bring big data solutions to the immune system.\r\n\r\nWhere are we and where are we going?\r\nWe have generated a database of over 1 million immune cells spanning healthy, cancerous, and autoimmune immune cells and are growing through paid partnerships. Harnessing out database and ML software, we can take a data-centric approach for better target discovery. Fortunately, as our database continues to grow, our models will continue to learn for more precise, unbiased, and automated single cell genomics.\r\n\r\nThank you!

Our focus is on being design-led and driving cutting-edge fintech innovation.\r\n\r\ngoDutch is founded by IIT Bombay grads with a total work experience of 10+ years in fintech and we are backed by global VC investors including Y Combinator.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Group payments product which lets people pay together at any offline…","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Fintech","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":13323,"name":"Snapboard","slug":"snapboard","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/0522d983927fe67359c98fe2c50c45dc70215d4c.png","website":"https://snapboard.io","all_locations":"London, England, United Kingdom","long_description":"","one_liner":"","team_size":2,"highlight_black":false,"highlight_latinx":false,"highlight_women":false,"industry":"B2B","subindustry":"B2B -> Productivity","launched_at":1583859484,"tags":[],"tags_highlighted":[],"top_company":false,"isHiring":false,"nonprofit":false,"batch":"W20","status":"Inactive","industries":["B2B","Productivity"],"regions":["United Kingdom","Europe"],"stage":"Early","app_video_public":false,"demo_day_video_public":false,"app_answers":null,"question_answers":false,"objectID":"13323","_highlightResult":{"name":{"value":"Snapboard","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"website":{"value":"https://snapboard.io","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"all_locations":{"value":"London, England, United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"long_description":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}}},{"id":13310,"name":"onetool","slug":"onetool","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/4c9e3624c4042da711e44a7963b397f112fdb69d.png","website":"https://onetool.co/","all_locations":"Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Remote","long_description":"Onetool provides businesses with their own app-store for business software.
