We've raised a total of $20M in funding from investors like Y-Combinator, Initialized Capital, co-founders of PlanGrid and Greycroft since launching 18 months ago. \r\n","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"1build helps builders win bids by converting blueprints into material…","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Machine Learning","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Artifical Intelligence","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":13120,"name":"Deep Meditate","slug":"deep-meditate","former_names":["DeepMeditate.com"],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/ca32262f0e21982f4e0ee321308b25dcdc0c3c46.png","website":"https://deepmeditate.com","location":"Waterloo, ON, Canada","long_description":"","one_liner":"Deep Meditate is an app that helps you de-stress, sleep, and…","team_size":1,"tags":["Consumer Health Services","Mental Health Tech"],"top_company":false,"isHiring":false,"nonprofit":false,"batch":"W20","status":"Active","industry":"Healthcare","subindustry":"Healthcare -> Consumer Health and Wellness","industries":["Healthcare","Consumer Health and Wellness"],"regions":["Canada","North America"],"objectID":"13120","_highlightResult":{"name":{"value":"Deep Meditate","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"former_names":[{"value":"DeepMeditate.com","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"website":{"value":"https://deepmeditate.com","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"location":{"value":"Waterloo, ON, Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"long_description":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Deep Meditate is an app that helps you de-stress, sleep, and…","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Consumer Health Services","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Mental Health Tech","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":13119,"name":"Ditto","slug":"ditto","former_names":["ditto"],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/74c7e5700b37d004a21b21f411b10e188028b085.png","website":"http://dittowords.com","location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","long_description":"Manage the words across your team’s product from design to production.","one_liner":"Manage the words across your team’s product from design to production.","team_size":5,"tags":["SaaS","Developer Tools","Design Tools"],"top_company":false,"isHiring":true,"nonprofit":false,"batch":"W20","status":"Active","industry":"B2B Software and Services","subindustry":"B2B Software and Services -> Engineering, Product and Design","industries":["B2B Software and Services","Engineering, Product and Design"],"regions":["United States","North America"],"objectID":"13119","_highlightResult":{"name":{"value":"Ditto","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"former_names":[{"value":"ditto","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"website":{"value":"http://dittowords.com","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"location":{"value":"San Francisco, CA, USA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"long_description":{"value":"Manage the words across your team’s product from design to production.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Manage the words across your team’s product from design to production.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"SaaS","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Developer Tools","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Design Tools","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":13118,"name":"Cyberdontics","slug":"cyberdontics","former_names":["Cyberdontics"],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/87b2822a4c0abe4ecc91b235730195d800f2ef3c.png","website":"https://www.cyberdontics.co","location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","long_description":"Developer of an image-guided robotic restorative dentistry platform for crowns and fillings.

Founded in 2018 by Bagrat Grigoryan and Jordan Miller as a spin-out from Rice University, the full potential of our work is to build whole human organ replacements for patients, made from their own cells.\r\n\r\nOur Technology and Approach\r\nWe have invented a suite of breakthrough 3D bioprinting technologies, featured on the cover of Science, that can build human tissue with complex blood vessel networks. We are leveraging this technology in the short term to build patient-specific tissues for drug safety and efficacy testing. Patient cells are taken from a biopsy, added to our proprietary 3D printed tissues, and then drug compounds are injected through the blood vessel network to mimic actual drug delivery in humans. Our vision is that our technology will provide rigorous, reproducible, and predictive outcomes for patients, resulting in drastically improved outcomes for diseases like cancer.
