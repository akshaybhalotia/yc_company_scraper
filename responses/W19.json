We believe that device reliability engineering will transform how developers build and operate IoT and edge devices with more productivity and more collaboration. As IoT applications continue to grow in complexity, it is more important than ever for developers to have Memfault’s performance monitoring, device debugging, and OTA update capabilities built into their fleet of devices for proactive device operations. We built Memfault to enable developers with a more scalable and sustainable process to accelerate go-to-market, de-risk product launches, cut product costs, and deliver overall superior products.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"First IoT reliability platform for debugging, monitoring, OTA updates","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"SaaS","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Developer Tools","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"IoT","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":12355,"name":"YourChoice Therapeutics","slug":"yourchoice-therapeutics","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/5ee153812f550aed3a1d617decff16839415814f.png","website":"http://ychoicetx.com","all_locations":"Berkeley, CA, USA","long_description":"YourChoice Therapeutics is revolutionizing the global contraceptive market.
