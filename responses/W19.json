For 100+ years, breath analysis (AKA metabolic testing, VO2max) has been the gold standard in anti-aging quantification, nutrition prescription, and evaluation of most critical systems, including the heart, lungs, cells, and nervous system. Until recently, it was only available in sophisticated clinics and regarded as the most valuable but underutilized assessment in medicine. PNOĒ changed that through the first easy-to-use clinical-grade breath analysis device, proprietary software package, and dedicated metabolic expert support. Through a non-invasive 10 min breath test, PNOĒ analyzes the human breath and prescribes a personalized nutrition, exercise, breathwork, and bio-optimization (i.e., red light therapy, hyperbaric chamber, IV therapy, etc.) program based on one’s biological limitations. 3,000+ health professionals trust PNOĒ because it personalizes the clients’ journey through their clinics, builds retention by quantifying progress, and enables the upsell of personalized nutrition and breathwork. All this without any effort, time commitment, or upfront cost. PNOĒ has been independently validated by Georgetown University, VA in Maryland, and Rutgers University and is trusted by leading institutions including Cenegenics, Dais Cove, MIT, UCLA, Pan Pacific, CLMBR, UCS, OURA, TONAL, Spartan Racing, and Paris Saint Germain.

For 100+ years, breath analysis (AKA metabolic testing, VO2max) has been the gold standard in anti-aging quantification, nutrition prescription, and evaluation of most critical systems, including the heart, lungs, cells, and nervous system. Until recently, it was only available in sophisticated clinics and regarded as the most valuable but underutilized assessment in medicine. PNOĒ changed that through the first easy-to-use clinical-grade breath analysis device, proprietary software package, and dedicated metabolic expert support. Through a non-invasive 10 min breath test, PNOĒ analyzes the human breath and prescribes a personalized nutrition, exercise, breathwork, and bio-optimization (i.e., red light therapy, hyperbaric chamber, IV therapy, etc.) program based on one’s biological limitations. 3,000+ health professionals trust PNOĒ because it personalizes the clients’ journey through their clinics, builds retention by quantifying progress, and enables the upsell of personalized nutrition and breathwork. All this without any effort, time commitment, or upfront cost.

Unfortunately, it has become difficult to foster such an environment in our ever-fragmented offline lives, despite our ever-connected online networks. We're working to change that.\r\n\r\nAllo aims to strengthen local networks of friends, families, and neighbors by giving them a better way to respond to each other’s needs. With Allo, asking for a favor is no longer awkward and connecting with the right group to find the social and practical support you need is simpler. \r\n\r\nBy making it easier for friends, families, and neighbors to connect, communicate, and coordinate online to help each other offline, we layer in a much-needed element of real-life, real-world interaction and community - something that everyone yearns for and families actually need to get by.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Allo is an app that helps neighboring families meet and help each…","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Community","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}}],"nbHits":194,"page":0,"nbPages":1,"hitsPerPage":1000,"facets":{"batch":{"W19":194},"status":{"Active":132,"Inactive":35,"Acquired":27},"regions":{"America / Canada":145,"United States of America":139,"Remote":128,"Partly Remote":72,"Fully Remote":56,"Europe":13,"Latin America":10,"India":8,"South Asia":8,"Africa":7,"Canada":6,"Nigeria":5,"Southeast Asia":5,"United Kingdom":5,"East Asia":4,"Unspecified":4,"Argentina":3,"Brazil":3,"China":3,"Germany":3,"Middle East and North Africa":3,"Singapore":3,"Colombia":2,"Israel":2,"Czechia":1,"France":1,"Greece":1,"Iceland":1,"Indonesia":1,"Iraq":1,"Malaysia":1,"Mexico":1,"Panama":1,"Peru":1,"Portugal":1,"Seychelles":1,"South Korea":1,"Spain":1,"Sweden":1,"Tanzania":1,"Ukraine":1,"Uruguay":1},"isHiring":{"false":153,"true":41},"nonprofit":{"false":191,"true":3},"industries":{"B2B":83,"Consumer":36,"Healthcare":24,"Fintech":22,"Engineering, Product and Design":18,"Industrials":15,"Operations":11,"Food and Beverage":10,"Supply Chain and Logistics":9,"Education":7,"Productivity":7,"Recruiting and Talent":7,"Therapeutics":7,"Healthcare IT":5,"Home and Personal":5,"Manufacturing and Robotics":5,"Real Estate and Construction":5,"Sales":5,"Banking and Exchange":4,"Consumer Finance":4,"Content":4,"Credit and Lending":4,"Gaming":4,"Housing and Real Estate":4,"Social":4,"Analytics":3,"Aviation and Space":3,"Climate":3,"Consumer Health and Wellness":3,"Diagnostics":3,"Healthcare Services":3,"Infrastructure":3,"Payments":3,"Retail":3,"Security":3,"Asset Management":2,"Energy":2,"Finance and Accounting":2,"Government":2,"Human Resources":2,"Industrial Bio":2,"Insurance":2,"Legal":2,"Marketing":2,"Office Management":2,"Travel, Leisure and Tourism":2,"Agriculture":1,"Apparel and Cosmetics":1,"Automotive":1,"Construction":1,"Transportation Services":1,"Virtual and Augmented Reality":1},"subindustry":{"B2B -> Engineering, Product and Design":18,"B2B -> Operations":11,"B2B -> Supply Chain and Logistics":10,"Consumer -> Food and Beverage":9,"B2B -> Productivity":7,"B2B -> Recruiting and Talent":7,"Education":7,"Healthcare -> Therapeutics":7,"Fintech -> Banking and Exchange":6,"B2B -> Sales":5,"Consumer -> Home and Personal":5,"Healthcare -> Healthcare IT":5,"Industrials -> Manufacturing and Robotics":5,"Consumer -> Content":4,"Consumer -> Gaming":4,"Consumer -> Social":4,"Consumer -> Travel, Leisure and Tourism":4,"Fintech -> Consumer Finance":4,"Fintech -> Credit and Lending":4,"Real Estate and Construction -> Housing and Real Estate":4,"B2B":3,"B2B -> Analytics":3,"B2B -> Finance and Accounting":3,"B2B -> Infrastructure":3,"B2B -> Retail":3,"B2B -> Security":3,"Fintech":3,"Healthcare -> Consumer Health and Wellness":3,"Healthcare -> Diagnostics":3,"Healthcare -> Healthcare Services":3,"Industrials -> Aviation and Space":3,"Industrials -> Climate":3,"B2B -> Human Resources":2,"B2B -> Legal":2,"B2B -> Marketing":2,"B2B -> Office Management":2,"Consumer":2,"Consumer -> Apparel and Cosmetics":2,"Fintech -> Insurance":2,"Fintech -> Payments":2,"Government":2,"Healthcare -> Industrial Bio":2,"Industrials -> Energy":2,"Consumer -> Transportation Services":1,"Consumer -> Virtual and Augmented Reality":1,"Fintech -> Asset Management":1,"Healthcare":1,"Industrials -> Agriculture":1,"Industrials -> Automotive":1},"top_company":{"false":192,"true":2}},"exhaustiveFacetsCount":true,"exhaustiveNbHits":true,"exhaustiveTypo":true,"exhaustive":{"facetsCount":true,"nbHits":true,"typo":true},"query":"","params":"hitsPerPage=1000&query=&page=0&facets=%5B%22top_company%22%2C%22isHiring%22%2C%22nonprofit%22%2C%22batch%22%2C%22industries%22%2C%22subindustry%22%2C%22status%22%2C%22regions%22%5D&tagFilters=&facetFilters=%5B%5B%22batch%3AW19%22%5D%5D&restrictIndices=YCCompany_production&tagFilters=%5B%22ycdc_public%22%5D&analyticsTags=%5B%22ycdc%22%5D","index":"YCCompany_production","renderingContent":{},"extensions":{"queryCategorization":{}},"processingTimeMS":2,"processingTimingsMS":{"_request":{"roundTrip":1},"afterFetch":{"format":{"highlighting":5,"total":8}},"extensions":2,"total":2},"serverTimeMS":11}]}
