Via the mecho app, a customer or business can make a request for any automobile service (repairs or regular servicing) or part. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"On-demand  auto maintenance & repairs","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Auto Commerce","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Marketplace","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"E-commerce","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":24914,"name":"Odiggo","slug":"odiggo","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/bd71806df011340df53463370352444dd427feb8.png","website":"https://www.odiggo.com","all_locations":"San Francisco, CA, USA; Remote","long_description":"**Purpose:** Be the earth’s most impactful company in helping humanity’s health.\r\n\r\n**Our Mission:** To expand doctors' capabilities to save more lives.\r\n\r\n**Target Customer:** Primary Care Doctors (who work in or have small clinics)\r\n\r\n**Product Goal:** Eliminate admin work for doctors\r\n   Problem: Doctors spend 50% of their time on admin work\r\n   Solution: AI Assistant for doctors that automates their admin work\r\n\r\n**Market / Opportunity:** $135 Billion is lost in doctors’ time spent on admin work.","one_liner":"Co-Pilot for doctors","team_size":2,"highlight_black":false,"highlight_latinx":false,"highlight_women":false,"industry":"B2B Software and Services","subindustry":"B2B Software and Services -> Productivity","tags":["Artificial Intelligence","SaaS","Health Tech","B2B","Healthcare"],"tags_highlighted":[],"top_company":false,"top_company_by_revenue":false,"isHiring":false,"nonprofit":false,"batch":"S21","status":"Active","industries":["B2B Software and Services","Productivity"],"regions":["United States of America","America / Canada","Remote","Partly Remote"],"stage":"Early","app_video_public":false,"demo_day_video_public":false,"app_answers":null,"question_answers":false,"objectID":"24914","_highlightResult":{"name":{"value":"Odiggo","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"website":{"value":"https://www.odiggo.com","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"all_locations":{"value":"San Francisco, CA, USA; Remote","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"long_description":{"value":"**Purpose:** Be the earth’s most impactful company in helping humanity’s health.\r\n\r\n**Our Mission:** To expand doctors' capabilities to save more lives.\r\n\r\n**Target Customer:** Primary Care Doctors (who work in or have small clinics)\r\n\r\n**Product Goal:** Eliminate admin work for doctors\r\n   Problem: Doctors spend 50% of their time on admin work\r\n   Solution: AI Assistant for doctors that automates their admin work\r\n\r\n**Market / Opportunity:** $135 Billion is lost in doctors’ time spent on admin work.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Co-Pilot for doctors","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Artificial Intelligence","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"SaaS","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Health Tech","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"B2B","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Healthcare","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":24913,"name":"Beau","slug":"beau","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/490af3b3db6da49a5b8d11c3a79ffeee287b7747.png","website":"https://beau.to","all_locations":"Remote; Barcelona, CT, Spain","long_description":"Beau helps to work with people outside your company: build, visualize, and automate your customer-facing processes!

Up to 80% of candidates who get invited to an interview, don't even show up.\r\n\r\nAt Hirebolt we eliminate all this work for employers, by finding actively-looking candidates, vetting them and automatically matching them to the best employers using AI. We schedule interviews and extend offers to candidates faster than humans can, giving employers time back to run their businesses.\r\n\r\nTo date, we’ve raised ~$1.5M from investors including Y Combinator, Entrepreneur First, world-class Venture Capital funds and industry leaders.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Hire staff fast without wasting hours on admin work ⚡️","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Recruiting","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"HR Tech","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":24754,"name":"Plai","slug":"plai","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/9e5edb26e5bdc44b210c50ed3cc68204303afbc9.png","website":"https://www.plai.io/","all_locations":"Remote; Los Angeles, CA, USA","long_description":"Plai is the advertising tool built for the 50million+ microbusinesses and creators.

We're starting by improving air cargo in remote regions like Alaska and northern Canada, and will expand to move less-than-truckload shipments in low density parts of the world.\r\n","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Using drone blimps to move middle mile air freight at half the cost.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Autonomous Delivery","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Robotics","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Drones","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":24587,"name":"Argus","slug":"argus","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/e2cb473ed161535672dc3db487d2e70dec2a74ec.png","website":"http://tryargus.com","all_locations":"New York, NY, USA; Remote","long_description":"Argus is the next generation of employee compliance software for crypto and finance.","one_liner":"The next generation of employee compliance","team_size":14,"highlight_black":false,"highlight_latinx":false,"highlight_women":false,"industry":"Financial Technology","subindustry":"Financial Technology","tags":["Fintech","B2B","Regtech"],"tags_highlighted":[],"top_company":false,"top_company_by_revenue":false,"isHiring":true,"nonprofit":false,"batch":"S21","status":"Active","industries":["Financial Technology"],"regions":["United States of America","America / Canada","Remote","Partly Remote"],"stage":"Early","app_video_public":false,"demo_day_video_public":false,"app_answers":null,"question_answers":false,"objectID":"24587","_highlightResult":{"name":{"value":"Argus","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"website":{"value":"http://tryargus.com","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"all_locations":{"value":"New York, NY, USA; Remote","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"long_description":{"value":"Argus is the next generation of employee compliance software for crypto and finance.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"The next generation of employee compliance","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Fintech","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"B2B","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Regtech","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":24586,"name":"Bedrock AI","slug":"bedrock-ai","former_names":["Bedrock AI Inc","Bedrock AI","Bedrock AI Inc"],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/51b3ed7630e5c65a5f81680ff716f815f17e4b4b.png","website":"https://bedrock-ai.com/","all_locations":"Remote; Toronto, ON, Canada","long_description":"Bedrock AI is software that extracts hard-to-find information in public company filing like annual reports.
