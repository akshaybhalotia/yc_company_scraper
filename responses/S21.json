We're two MIT hardware engineers who've been friends for almost a decade, and we've built satellites and antennas at Astranis, Wafer, and OneWeb. So far, we’ve built and flown four airships - our most recent is 20 feet long and capable of speeds up to 35 miles per hour. We’ve also closed $5 million in LOIs and have two pilot programs planned. We're starting by improving air cargo in remote regions like Alaska and northern Canada, and will expand to move less-than-truckload shipments in low density parts of the world.\r\n","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Using drone blimps to move middle mile air freight at half the cost.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Drones","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Robotics","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Autonomous Delivery","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":24587,"name":"Argus","slug":"argus","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/e2cb473ed161535672dc3db487d2e70dec2a74ec.png","website":"http://","location":"New York, NY, USA","long_description":"Argus lets the bankers, consultants, alternative asset investors and others trade their $5T of liquid assets easily in line with employer compliance restrictions.","one_liner":"Unlocking the $5T of assets of employees with employer restrictions","team_size":9,"tags":["B2B","Fintech"],"top_company":false,"isHiring":true,"nonprofit":false,"batch":"S21","status":"Active","industry":"Financial Technology","subindustry":"Financial Technology","industries":["Financial Technology"],"regions":["United States","North America"],"objectID":"24587","_highlightResult":{"name":{"value":"Argus","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"website":{"value":"http://","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"location":{"value":"New York, NY, USA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"long_description":{"value":"Argus lets the bankers, consultants, alternative asset investors and others trade their $5T of liquid assets easily in line with employer compliance restrictions.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Unlocking the $5T of assets of employees with employer restrictions","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"B2B","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Fintech","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":24586,"name":"Bedrock AI","slug":"bedrock-ai","former_names":["Bedrock AI Inc","Bedrock AI","Bedrock AI Inc"],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/2664b870cd5a68d3b9210a032530fc0a287c05c2.png","website":"https://bedrock-ai.com/","location":"Toronto, ON, Canada","long_description":"Bedrock AI is software that extracts hard-to-find information in public company filing like annual reports.
