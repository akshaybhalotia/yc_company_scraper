Our seaglider flies a few meters above the water and replaces ferries and short-haul aircraft on coastal routes.  This maritime environment allows us to halve the decade-long development cycle for aircraft and eVTOLs.  By operating within a wingspan of the water, seagliders have double the range of electric aircraft thanks to aerodynamic and operational efficiencies.  \r\n\r\nUnlike conventional aircraft configurations, our first seaglider will be capable of 180 miles at 180 mph with existing battery technology. Beginning in 2025, our seagliders will commence real world operations, build consumer trust, and generate revenue while our aircraft-building competitors are still embroiled in regulatory and technical challenges. In the future, when those challenges have been overcome, REGENT will transition seagliders to the air and grow upon years of commercial success.\r\n\r\nIn the last 3 months we have closed $250M in LOIs from airlines and ferry companies.

This optimizes for increasing the number of people coming through the front doors of the course. Once they are in, there is not much incentive to actually deliver a good learning experience. It quickly shifts from a game of education to a game of marketing.\r\n\r\nWe think this can be fixed. This can be fixed with clear crypto-economic incentives that aligns with the actual learning outcomes of the learners. We're creating a University DAO, one that is decentralized and permissionless.
