Reclaim Protocol : our underlying infrastructure that makes BlueCheck possible. With advancements in cryptography, specifically zero knowledge proofs - our research over the last 3 years have resulted in inventing a new cryptographic primitive called zkTLS, which allows us to verify information from any website using the cryptography of the existing internet pipes (TLS). This is our secret sauce!\r\n3. Questbook : our dog-fooding tool. Questbook is a tool to give out research and open source software development grants. These grants are reviewed by AI agents that we built inhouse. The biggest scam people try is to fake who they are when they are applying for grants. We dog-food our own tools to make sure we verify all the claims the users are making when they apply for grants. Our tools secure more than $10M of grants being given out on the platform.

A dating app uses our tools to verify the users' information - including their employment, education and financial background. This was something that would have been too expensive to verify at a $10 pricepoint where the ARPU is only $8. \r\n\r\nNot only that, we're designing the tools ground up - so that AI agents can utilize these verifications before ingesting information, so that they take action basis truthful information.\r\n\r\nWe have 3 tools\r\n1. BlueCheck : our flagship product for background verification. The cheapest option to verify users' employment, education and financial background. A few cents instead of a few tens of dollars. Several Billion Dollar+ revenue companies are customers. A solution designed for enterprises that works out of the box!\r\n2. Reclaim Protocol : our underlying infrastructure that makes BlueCheck possible. With advancements in cryptography, specifically zero knowledge proofs - our research over the last 3 years have resulted in inventing a new cryptographic primitive called zkTLS, which allows us to verify information from any website using the cryptography of the existing internet pipes (TLS). This is our secret sauce!\r\n3. Questbook : our dog-fooding tool. Questbook is a tool to give out research and open source software development grants. These grants are reviewed by AI agents that we built inhouse. The biggest scam people try is to fake who they are when they are applying for grants. We dog-food our own tools to make sure we verify all the claims the users are making when they apply for grants. Our tools secure more than $10M of grants being given out on the platform. So it's high stakes, and it works!","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Building tools for verifying information consumed by AI agents","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"AIOps","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Crypto / Web3","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Identity","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"API","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"AI","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":23075,"name":"Sturdy","slug":"sturdy-2","former_names":["Trained Eye","Sturdy"],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/ad9396b9cebc1da00df8e848c265dd081f363791.png","website":"https://sturdy.finance","all_locations":"","long_description":"","one_liner":"DeFi protocol for permissionless lending","team_size":11,"industry":"Fintech","subindustry":"Fintech -> Credit and Lending","launched_at":1616256593,"tags":["DeFi","Fintech","Lending"],"tags_highlighted":[],"top_company":false,"isHiring":false,"nonprofit":false,"batch":"W21","status":"Active","industries":["Fintech","Credit and Lending"],"regions":["Unspecified"],"stage":"Early","app_video_public":false,"demo_day_video_public":false,"app_answers":null,"question_answers":false,"objectID":"23075","_highlightResult":{"name":{"value":"Sturdy","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"former_names":[{"value":"Trained Eye","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Sturdy","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"website":{"value":"https://sturdy.finance","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"all_locations":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"long_description":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"DeFi protocol for permissionless lending","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"DeFi","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Fintech","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Lending","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":23074,"name":"ZOKO","slug":"zoko","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/88a29ec13035e5082aa0fc15b5e1d34257c60895.png","website":"https://www.zoko.io/","all_locations":"Bengaluru, KA, India; Dubai, Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Remote","long_description":"Zoko makes it easy for businesses, to do Sales, Marketing and Customer Support on WhatsApp. \r\n\r\nThere are 100 million merchants worldwide, already using WhatsApp for their businesses.
