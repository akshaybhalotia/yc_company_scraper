IT teams from companies like Zeplin and Sary save 30 minutes on every request.\r\n\r\nAccess management used to be an enterprise problem. With work from home, exploding SaaS usage and the need for SOC2 certifications startups have the same problems as enterprises. \r\n\r\nMathias and Philip have built several startups and teams before and experienced the same problems around access management over and over again. Philip was the CEO and Co-Founder of blik, an award winning IoT solution that was used by Volkswagen and BMW. Mathias built the leading private payment infrastructure provider in Germany as well as the first digital car insurance as Co-Founder and CTO. Based on these experiences we decided to build a solution we wish we could have used when building our former companies.\r\n\r\nAccessOwl can be deployed within minutes instead of weeks by simply installing a Slack application. We save companies that use AccessOwl 30 minutes for every access request, on- and offboarding.

The patent-pending ALT TEX fermentation technology creates a polyester alternative that works with the existing infrastructure to supply a sustainable, high performance and cost competitive polyester replacement to fashion brands, at scale. \r\n\r\nThe product solves key problems for fashion brands, consumers, and the environment:\r\n\r\n(1) Fashion brands: ALT TEX sells fabric to fashion brands, allowing them to differentiate via sustainable options (sustainable fashion growing 11% CAGR) and hit sustainability targets, without sacrificing performance or changing their current supply chain.\r\n\r\n(2) Consumer: The ALT TEX fabric is projected to be half the price vs. other specialized sustainable alternatives (due to low-cost input and scalability), meaning greater accessibility.\r\n\r\n(3) Environment: A single shirt produced with ALT TEX fabric can divert 1 kg of food waste from landfills, 9 kg of carbon emissions from the air, and 4 g of micro-plastics from our waterways.\r\n\r\nCo-founders Myra and Avneet have worked together managing teams and projects for six years, with backgrounds in serial entrepreneurship, corporate sales at Fortune 500 companies, textile manufacturing and biochemistry.

Polyester alone makes up 60% of the $2.5 trillion fashion industry and is the biggest blocker preventing brands from meeting sustainability mandates. The patent-pending ALT TEX fermentation technology creates a polyester alternative that works with the existing infrastructure to supply a sustainable, high performance and cost competitive polyester replacement to fashion brands, at scale. \r\n\r\nThe product solves key problems for fashion brands, consumers, and the environment:\r\n\r\n(1) Fashion brands: ALT TEX sells fabric to fashion brands, allowing them to differentiate via sustainable options (sustainable fashion growing 11% CAGR) and hit sustainability targets, without sacrificing performance or changing their current supply chain.\r\n\r\n(2) Consumer: The ALT TEX fabric is projected to be half the price vs. other specialized sustainable alternatives (due to low-cost input and scalability), meaning greater accessibility.\r\n\r\n(3) Environment: A single shirt produced with ALT TEX fabric can divert 1 kg of food waste from landfills, 9 kg of carbon emissions from the air, and 4 g of micro-plastics from our waterways.\r\n\r\nCo-founders Myra and Avneet have worked together managing teams and projects for six years, with backgrounds in serial entrepreneurship, corporate sales at Fortune 500 companies, textile manufacturing and biochemistry. To date, ALT TEX has created their first fabric prototype that’s 70% stronger than cotton, secured $1M in LOIs and raised $2.3M.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Biodegradable and carbon neutral textiles, engineered from food waste.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Carbon Capture and Removal","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Bioplastic","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Biotech","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Climate","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Food Tech","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":26768,"name":"Disclo","slug":"disclo","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/e168db75ab4f6e439a5dece49f30bdbbbedfd7f6.png","website":"http://www.disclo.com","all_locations":"Remote; Austin, TX, USA; Atlanta, GA, USA","long_description":"Disclo is the first software for employers to collect, verify, and manage health disclosures and employee accommodation requests (HIPAA and SOC2 compliant, of course).\r\n\r\nWe help employees secure the enhancements and protections they need to succeed in their careers without having to disclose their underlying medical condition to their employer.

It aims to solve the main challenges currently facing the biotech industry to develop mRNA-based therapeutics – quality, quantity, longevity and cost of mRNA. As mRNA technology matures, it becomes imperative that these issues are solved so we can fully explore mRNA's endless possibilities as a therapeutic.\r\n\r\nCisterna uses proprietary technologies to either remove a contaminant at its source or replace the source itself. For example, to remove double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), we use ribozymes - molecular scissors - to precisely cut the mRNA at its 3’ end. This assures not only 3’ homogeneity, but also eliminates dsRNA, which are primarily produced due to self-templated additions at the 3’ end. Utilizing a PCR-like system to amplify the DNA template in large quantities eliminates the requirement for plasmid enrichment in bacteria, the prime source of endotoxin contamination.

It aims to solve the main challenges currently facing the biotech industry to develop mRNA-based therapeutics – quality, quantity, longevity and cost of mRNA. As mRNA technology matures, it becomes imperative that these issues are solved so we can fully explore mRNA's endless possibilities as a therapeutic.\r\n\r\nCisterna uses proprietary technologies to either remove a contaminant at its source or replace the source itself. For example, to remove double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), we use ribozymes - molecular scissors - to precisely cut the mRNA at its 3’ end. This assures not only 3’ homogeneity, but also eliminates dsRNA, which are primarily produced due to self-templated additions at the 3’ end.
