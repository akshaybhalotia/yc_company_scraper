From bill payment, corporate card, local and international transfer, to employee’s expense claim, Spenmo helps companies streamline their AP processes with our technology. \r\n\r\nBefore Spenmo, AP staff were drowned in manual work and struggled to reconcile all their spending on time. Not anymore. Thousands of businesses are now using Spenmo to payout their AP, track and categorize spend, and close their books on auto-pilot in 90% less time. On average, finance teams who use Spenmo save over 50 hours and $10,000 every month.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"A spend management software that provides businesses visibility,…","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Fintech","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"SaaS","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":22141,"name":"SafeBase","slug":"safebase","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/11ecc83b03cfcf5e3849e1ca5f104ded4d413551.png","website":"https://www.safebase.io","all_locations":"San Francisco, CA, USA; Remote","long_description":"Trust Center Platform\r\n\r\nSafeBase Trust Center enables Security teams to proactively share and automate access to security, compliance, and privacy information/ complete security questionnaires.\r\n","one_liner":"Trust Center platform that scales customer security reviews","team_size":60,"highlight_black":false,"highlight_latinx":false,"highlight_women":false,"industry":"B2B","subindustry":"B2B -> Security","launched_at":1595995902,"tags":["SaaS","Productivity","Cybersecurity"],"tags_highlighted":[],"top_company":false,"isHiring":true,"nonprofit":false,"batch":"S20","status":"Active","industries":["B2B","Security"],"regions":["United States of America","America / Canada","Remote","Fully Remote"],"stage":"Growth","app_video_public":false,"demo_day_video_public":false,"app_answers":null,"question_answers":false,"objectID":"22141","_highlightResult":{"name":{"value":"SafeBase","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"website":{"value":"https://www.safebase.io","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"all_locations":{"value":"San Francisco, CA, USA; Remote","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"long_description":{"value":"Trust Center Platform\r\n\r\nSafeBase Trust Center enables Security teams to proactively share and automate access to security, compliance, and privacy information/ complete security questionnaires.\r\n","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Trust Center platform that scales customer security reviews","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"SaaS","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Productivity","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Cybersecurity","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":22131,"name":"DraftWise","slug":"draftwise","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/718046638373d3ceab63b7430c6b668859bb2cc2.png","website":"https://www.draftwise.com/","all_locations":"New York, NY, USA","long_description":"DraftWise is on a mission to transform the legal industry by harnessing the power of AI.

Our technology first applies predictive models of protein structure and function to generate sets of potentially active protein sequences. We then apply our state-of-the-art sequence optimization algorithm to design gene libraries capable of testing these candidates extremely quickly and affordably. By combining these technologies, we're closing the design-build-test loop of protein optimization and cutting the total cycle time to help bring synthetic proteins to market faster than ever before.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Accelerating protein engineering.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Hard Tech","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Machine Learning","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":13173,"name":"Racer","slug":"racer","former_names":["Lyncsolar","Magic","Origami makes robots that make sushi","Origami","TBD","Racer","TBD"],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/4363c854a3940fa0d1c373b45b6123eb380d1927.png","website":"http://racer.app","all_locations":"New York, NY, USA","long_description":"","one_liner":"15-minute food delivery","team_size":7,"highlight_black":false,"highlight_latinx":false,"highlight_women":true,"industry":"Consumer","subindustry":"Consumer -> Food and Beverage","launched_at":1606355690,"tags":["Delivery","Food & Beverage"],"tags_highlighted":[],"top_company":false,"isHiring":false,"nonprofit":false,"batch":"S20","status":"Inactive","industries":["Consumer","Food and Beverage"],"regions":["United States of America","America / Canada"],"stage":"Early","app_video_public":false,"demo_day_video_public":false,"app_answers":null,"question_answers":false,"objectID":"13173","_highlightResult":{"name":{"value":"Racer","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"former_names":[{"value":"Lyncsolar","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Magic","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Origami makes robots that make sushi","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Origami","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"TBD","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Racer","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"TBD","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"website":{"value":"http://racer.app","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"all_locations":{"value":"New York, NY, USA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"long_description":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"15-minute food delivery","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Delivery","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Food & Beverage","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":13159,"name":"Openbase","slug":"openbase","former_names":["Devstore"],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/dc87029e5a78d6cc28d8d10fc173581df6c2afa6.png","website":"https://openbase.com","all_locations":"San Francisco, CA, USA;
