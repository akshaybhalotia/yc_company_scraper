Aesthetic. Minimalistic. Electric.\r\n\r\nOlympian Motors is a new, disruptive automaker, building the most aesthetic, minimalistic, and software-defined Electric Vehicles.\r\n\r\n•  Received 157 pre-orders for Olympian Model O1  ($15M+ pre-booked revenue)\r\n•  Radically minimalistic cockpit and 'data-privacy-first' architecture powered by Olympian Operating System (OOS)\r\n•  Rapid go-to-market: We have secured key partnerships to deliver the first Olympian O1 EVs  to customers by November 2022. (It took 9+ years for Lucid and 11+ years for Rivian to make their first commercial shipment).\r\n•  Olympian has a unique fully 'fabless' production model in the U.S., running an asset-light operation with no CAPEX or no front R&D - unlike other conventional EV companies in the U.S.\r\n•  We disrupt today’s commoditized car experience, elevate low quality/comfort standards, simplify over-complicated cockpit/UX, and create a new ‘experience-first’ consumer segment in the automotive.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe prioritize:\r\n- Aesthetics over horsepower\r\n- User experience over torque\r\n- Classiness over top-speed\r\n- Data privacy or data exchange\r\n- Edge computing over cloud computing\r\n- Minimalism over 30+ buttons and switches in the cockpit\r\n- AR HUD over 2D Display screens\r\n- Wood, steel and titanium materials over cheap plastic and veneer\r\n- Sustainable & natural materials over toxic chemicals\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are creating the next big story in automotive.\r\n","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Building aesthetic, minimalistic & software-defined Electric Vehicles","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Transportation","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Consumer","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"ClimateTech","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Climate","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Electric Vehicles","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":26049,"name":"Netmaker","slug":"netmaker","former_names":["Gravitl"],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/b3c3a99ff41b4e029c9cc8c8084119c4e97eb919.png","website":"https://gravitl.com","location":"Asheville, NC, USA","long_description":"Netmaker is an open source virtual networking platform based on WireGuard.
