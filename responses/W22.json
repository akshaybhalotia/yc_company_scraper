But getting a tutor is a hassle. \r\nOnline classes are convenient but kids are not excited about Zoom.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLUTION 💚\r\n\r\nFor the last 4 years, our team of ex-Apple engineers has been working with hundreds of teachers and education neurologists. We built Koala Go, an interactive, gamified platform to engage young students online. Koala Go won awards and our company is now backed by Y Combinator!\r\n\r\nStarting in 2023, you can now book classes by the very best Koala online teachers which will happen on our platform.\r\n\r\nKids get so excited about learning with Koala that teachers have a hard time getting them to leave at the end of class.\r\n\r\nFind your class at https://www.learnwithkoala.com 😊\r\n\r\nCan't find the class or time you need?

We facilitate promotions for FMCG brands in our stores, boosting sales by 10-60%. \r\n\r\nOur founding team has worked with large brands like Coca-Cola, Mondelez and AB Inbev, where we learned that brands spend 20% of revenues on promotions, making it a $3B opportunity in Southeast Asia. \r\n","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Promotions-enabled mobile POS for cornerstores.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Analytics","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Enterprise","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"B2B","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Fintech","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":25350,"name":"Nest Genomics","slug":"nest-genomics","former_names":["Applied Genomics","Guide Genomics","Pepper Genomics"],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/c965d20fc0bacd98d8b38c9742848bdb11b05841.png","website":"https://nestgenomics.com","all_locations":"Remote; New York, NY, USA","long_description":"Nest is a lab-agnostic, comprehensive solution for organizations to launch and implement large-scale genomic programs.

They have large data science teams that build such in-house recommendation engines. However, DTC brands can't afford to do this, and they don't have enough customer data to make the conventional recommendation approaches work. Suggestr uses innovative multi-modal AI technology that sees and understands products (needs 100x less data), allowing it to work with brands of all sizes (SME, mid-market, enterprise).
