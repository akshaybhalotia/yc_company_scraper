We take a code first approach and everything lives in your code, and runs locally (completely open-source!).\r\n\r\nInstead of function-calling on openai and JSON.parse, our approach allows you to write shorter prompts that lead to more accurate results. No fine-tuning. No modifying the model.\r\nThat means less time prompt engineering to get the same quality results.\r\n\r\nRecently, we showed that our method makes GPT-3.5, GPT-4o-mini, and Claude-Haiku perform at the same level as GPT-4o without (of course GPT-4o gets better with us as well).
