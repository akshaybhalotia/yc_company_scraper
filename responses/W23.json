Unless you’re a big tech company or someone like Stitch Fix that can afford a platform team, staffing teams with high ratios of data engineers, or finding unicorn data scientists that can build ML ETLs is your only option; it not only slows time to value for ML, it makes operating ML expensive. \r\n\r\nWe’re here to change that. Think simple python that enables a low software engineering bar to describe what should happen, and then with some extra metadata, generates the workflow code and manages integrations with MLOps tools of your choice, all in a self-service manner. It’s functional and usable by junior and senior folks alike.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Open Source ML ETL platform for Data Science teams","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Developer Tools","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Data Engineering","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Machine Learning","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Open Source","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"B2B","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":28079,"name":"Invopop","slug":"invopop","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/c09f91b840f8f6e3d460a90c1be16b55caaf240a.png","website":"https://www.invopop.com/","all_locations":"San Francisco, CA, USA; London, England, United Kingdom; Madrid, Community of Madrid, Spain; Remote","long_description":"Invopop is a platform that makes it easier for developers to convert sales into electronic invoices anywhere in the world. \r\n\r\nFor example, a developer at a company with operations in multiple countries only needs to create a single integration with an open source format, send it to Invopop, and forget about all the stress of building PDFs, compliance with tax agencies, and integrations with ERPs or other systems.","one_liner":"Platform for developers to convert sales into e-invoices, globally.","team_size":5,"highlight_black":false,"highlight_latinx":false,"highlight_women":false,"industry":"B2B Software and Services","subindustry":"B2B Software and Services -> Finance and Accounting","tags":["Fintech","Payments"],"tags_highlighted":[],"top_company":false,"isHiring":false,"nonprofit":false,"batch":"W23","status":"Active","industries":["B2B Software and Services","Finance and Accounting"],"regions":["United States of America","United Kingdom","Spain","America / Canada","Europe","Remote","Partly Remote"],"stage":"Early","app_video_public":false,"demo_day_video_public":false,"app_answers":null,"question_answers":false,"objectID":"28079","_highlightResult":{"name":{"value":"Invopop","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"website":{"value":"https://www.invopop.com/","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"all_locations":{"value":"San Francisco, CA, USA; London, England, United Kingdom; Madrid, Community of Madrid, Spain; Remote","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"long_description":{"value":"Invopop is a platform that makes it easier for developers to convert sales into electronic invoices anywhere in the world. \r\n\r\nFor example, a developer at a company with operations in multiple countries only needs to create a single integration with an open source format, send it to Invopop, and forget about all the stress of building PDFs, compliance with tax agencies, and integrations with ERPs or other systems.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Platform for developers to convert sales into e-invoices, globally.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Fintech","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Payments","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":28078,"name":"Turntable","slug":"turntable","former_names":["Curious Data"],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/2dfe803e31176ba4760f7416a30ab05e1f66d7a4.png","website":"https://www.turntable.so","all_locations":"San Francisco, CA, USA; Remote","long_description":"Turntable allows less technical analysts to build their own data pipelines.
