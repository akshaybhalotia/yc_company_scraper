We integrate directly with help desk software and focus on helping large Shopify merchants deal with their high volume of support requests.\r\n \r\n## Why do Shopify merchants need Yuma?\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of Shopify merchants around the world generating $10M+ a year. Most of them have taken over some niches and are great at what they do: selling their products.\r\n\r\nBut they all have one thing in common: they all hate customer support. It's a burden for them and a huge source of cost, as they receive hundreds of requests per day. Some of them have dozens of support agents on staff, usually offshore, and the overall quality is still often pretty poor while staff turnover remains high.\r\n\r\nThose merchants have been promised automation for years but have always been disappointed by the outcome. As customers, we have all had to live through a terrible support automation experience before, so this is no secret, and everyone knows that the current state of the technology is quite bad.\r\n\r\n## Yuma is solving this in a few ways:\r\n\r\nFirst and most importantly, we believe that the recent advances in AI technology finally make solving this problem achievable.\r\n\r\nBy coupling LLMs with custom-built knowledge bases, Yuma is able to suggest drafts that are relevant and customized to the support agents. With a one-click install, Yuma can natively integrate with any help desk software without disrupting current workflows, but only augmenting them.\r\n\r\nBy using LLMs to analyze historical tickets, Yuma can mimic the writing style of a brand, but also learn and replicate current workflows without any configuration needed, bringing the setup and adoption cost to almost zero.\r\n\r\nYuma also offers the ability to build a new kind of smart and dynamic workflows that were not possible before, with a plain English description of a given scenario.\r\n\r\nFinally, LLMs also make working with multiple languages a breeze. The agents can focus their work on a single language, knowing that their output will always be appropriate and grammatically correct.\r\n\r\n## Fun Fact\r\n\r\nYuma got started by accident. This is my third YC startup after Socialcam (W12) and Triplebyte (S15). I released Yuma as a prototype for fun in mid-December 2022 and was overwhelmed with demo requests.

Spin off AI phone calls in a single line of code https://vocode.dev \r\n\r\nOur open source library makes it easy for developers to build voice-based LLM applications. We provide abstractions for streaming 2-way conversation (this is good for realtime apps like phone calls) and for command-based/turn-based applications (like voice-based chess). The library has integrations to most major speech recognition/synthesis providers and platform support across web and telephony (via Twilio).\r\n\r\nIt’s easy to get up and running–simple use cases are just 10 lines of code.

We’re building an open core SaaS platform to streamline development and operation of data, ML, & LLM pipelines in a collaborative, self-service manner, utilizing a company's existing MLOps and data infrastructure.\r\n\r\nWe believe self-service for Data Practitioners is the future because it enables domain modeling experts the velocity to iterate on pipelines & models without hand-off, which is key for businesses using ML/AI to differentiate themselves. Unless you’re a big tech company or someone like Stitch Fix that can afford a platform team, staffing teams with high ratios of engineers, or finding unicorn data scientists that can build pipelines is your only option; it not only slows time to value, it makes operating ML/AI expensive. \r\n\r\nWe’re here to change that. Think simple python that enables a low software engineering bar to describe what should happen, and then with some extra metadata, generates the workflow code, and that also consolidates several MLOps tools into a single platform, all in a self-service manner.
