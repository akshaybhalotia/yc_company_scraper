We integrate directly with help desk software and focus on helping large Shopify merchants deal with their high volume of support requests.\r\n \r\n## Why do Shopify merchants need Yuma?\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of Shopify merchants around the world generating $10M+ a year. Most of them have taken over some niches and are great at what they do: selling their products.\r\n\r\nBut they all have one thing in common: they all hate customer support. It's a burden for them and a huge source of cost, as they receive hundreds of requests per day. Some of them have dozens of support agents on staff, usually offshore, and the overall quality is still often pretty poor while staff turnover remains high.\r\n\r\nThose merchants have been promised automation for years but have always been disappointed by the outcome. As customers, we have all had to live through a terrible support automation experience before, so this is no secret, and everyone knows that the current state of the technology is quite bad.\r\n\r\n## Yuma is solving this in a few ways:\r\n\r\nFirst and most importantly, we believe that the recent advances in AI technology finally make solving this problem achievable.\r\n\r\nBy coupling LLMs with custom-built knowledge bases, Yuma is able to suggest drafts that are relevant and customized to the support agents. With a one-click install, Yuma can natively integrate with any help desk software without disrupting current workflows, but only augmenting them.\r\n\r\nBy using LLMs to analyze historical tickets, Yuma can mimic the writing style of a brand, but also learn and replicate current workflows without any configuration needed, bringing the setup and adoption cost to almost zero.\r\n\r\nYuma also offers the ability to build a new kind of smart and dynamic workflows that were not possible before, with a plain English description of a given scenario.\r\n\r\nFinally, LLMs also make working with multiple languages a breeze. The agents can focus their work on a single language, knowing that their output will always be appropriate and grammatically correct.\r\n\r\n## Fun Fact\r\n\r\nYuma got started by accident. This is my third YC startup after Socialcam (W12) and Triplebyte (S15). I released Yuma as a prototype for fun in mid-December 2022 and was overwhelmed with demo requests.

Unless you’re a big tech company or someone like Stitch Fix that can afford a platform team, staffing teams with high ratios of data engineers, or finding unicorn data scientists that can build pipelines is your only option; it not only slows time to value for ML, it makes operating ML expensive. \r\n\r\nWe’re here to change that. Think simple python that enables a low software engineering bar to describe what should happen, and then with some extra metadata, generates the workflow code, and that also consolidates several MLOps tools into a single platform, all in a self-service manner. It’s functional and usable by junior and senior folks alike.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Unifying Platform Layer for Data & ML Pipelines","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Developer Tools","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Machine Learning","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"B2B","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Open Source","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Data Engineering","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":28080,"name":"Swishjam","slug":"swishjam","former_names":["Tagsafe"],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/d607b93f3da26fde36fd956fe7b3fb67f045e121.png","website":"https://swishjam.com","all_locations":"Remote; Los Angeles, CA, USA","long_description":"Swishjam is an open-source set of tools to help you measure, monitor, and optimize the speed of your site to give your users a perfect experience.","one_liner":"Open-source page speed tools to help you build incredible experiences","team_size":2,"highlight_black":false,"highlight_latinx":false,"highlight_women":false,"industry":"B2B Software and Services","subindustry":"B2B Software and Services -> Engineering, Product and Design","tags":["Developer Tools","SaaS","B2B"],"tags_highlighted":[],"top_company":false,"top_company_by_revenue":false,"isHiring":false,"nonprofit":false,"batch":"W23","status":"Active","industries":["B2B Software and Services","Engineering, Product and Design"],"regions":["United States of America","America / Canada","Remote","Fully Remote"],"stage":"Early","app_video_public":false,"demo_day_video_public":false,"app_answers":null,"question_answers":false,"objectID":"28080","_highlightResult":{"name":{"value":"Swishjam","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"former_names":[{"value":"Tagsafe","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"website":{"value":"https://swishjam.com","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"all_locations":{"value":"Remote; Los Angeles, CA, USA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"long_description":{"value":"Swishjam is an open-source set of tools to help you measure, monitor, and optimize the speed of your site to give your users a perfect experience.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Open-source page speed tools to help you build incredible experiences","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Developer Tools","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"SaaS","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"B2B","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":28079,"name":"Invopop","slug":"invopop","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/c09f91b840f8f6e3d460a90c1be16b55caaf240a.png","website":"https://www.invopop.com/","all_locations":"San Francisco, CA, USA; London, England, United Kingdom; Madrid, Community of Madrid, Spain; Remote","long_description":"Invopop helps global software companies comply with local tax reporting requirements.\r\nWe offer an API that records every sale and reports it to the appropriate tax authority in the right format.  \r\n\r\nIn the last years, +15 countries have started to require businesses to report to tax authorities every sale, in real-time (e.g., India, Mexico, Brazil).
