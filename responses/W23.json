A supply chain isn't just a build-time check, it's highly dynamic. EdgeBit watches in real time – we cross-reference your build pipelines and server fleet with multiple data sources to communicate your live inventory and actual risk.\r\n\r\nSecurity teams aren’t experts at their company’s apps, so they are forced to distract the most skilled engineers with a firehose of vulnerabilities to investigate. We founded EdgeBit because we believe that we can solve this problem — to empower security teams to prioritize investigation of true risks without wasting engineers time.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Inbox Zero for Supply Chain Security","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"B2B","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Security","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"DevSecOps","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Developer Tools","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":27807,"name":"ZeroDev","slug":"zerodev","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/a30005e91ad35585a4b56bcea0746fd934004f30.png","website":"https://zerodev.app/","all_locations":"New York, NY, USA; Remote","long_description":"Using our SDK, you can easily build a Web3 onboarding flow that:\r\n\r\n- Can be embedded inside any DApp (browser/mobile)\r\n- Supports social login (no seed phrases)\r\n- Supports gas-less transactions (through account abstraction)\r\n- And more!!","one_liner":"Build the best Web3 onboarding experience in 5 lines of code!","team_size":1,"highlight_black":false,"highlight_latinx":false,"highlight_women":false,"industry":"B2B Software and Services","subindustry":"B2B Software and Services -> Infrastructure","tags":["Crypto / Web3"],"tags_highlighted":["Crypto / Web3"],"top_company":false,"isHiring":false,"nonprofit":false,"batch":"W23","status":"Active","industries":["B2B Software and Services","Infrastructure"],"regions":["United States of America","America / Canada","Remote","Partly Remote"],"stage":"Early","app_video_public":false,"demo_day_video_public":false,"app_answers":null,"question_answers":false,"objectID":"27807","_highlightResult":{"name":{"value":"ZeroDev","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"website":{"value":"https://zerodev.app/","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"all_locations":{"value":"New York, NY, USA; Remote","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"long_description":{"value":"Using our SDK, you can easily build a Web3 onboarding flow that:\r\n\r\n- Can be embedded inside any DApp (browser/mobile)\r\n- Supports social login (no seed phrases)\r\n- Supports gas-less transactions (through account abstraction)\r\n- And more!!","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Build the best Web3 onboarding experience in 5 lines of code!","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Crypto / Web3","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":27766,"name":"Glass Health","slug":"glass-health","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/8840ad2fde72591e0941f2a0535fc07a91e09da7.png","website":"http://glass.health","all_locations":"San Francisco, CA, USA","long_description":"Glass is a medical knowledge management platform, a.k.a. “Notion for doctors,” that helps physicians learn medicine faster and leverage their knowledge to provide better care for patients.","one_liner":"Frictionless software for learning and practicing medicine","team_size":2,"highlight_black":true,"highlight_latinx":false,"highlight_women":false,"industry":"Healthcare","subindustry":"Healthcare -> Healthcare IT","tags":["Digital Health","Health Tech","SaaS","Healthcare"],"tags_highlighted":[],"top_company":false,"isHiring":false,"nonprofit":false,"batch":"W23","status":"Active","industries":["Healthcare","Healthcare IT"],"regions":["United States of America","America / Canada"],"stage":"Early","app_video_public":false,"demo_day_video_public":false,"app_answers":null,"question_answers":false,"objectID":"27766","_highlightResult":{"name":{"value":"Glass Health","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"website":{"value":"http://glass.health","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"all_locations":{"value":"San Francisco, CA, USA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"long_description":{"value":"Glass is a medical knowledge management platform, a.k.a. “Notion for doctors,” that helps physicians learn medicine faster and leverage their knowledge to provide better care for patients.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Frictionless software for learning and practicing medicine","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Digital Health","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Health Tech","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"SaaS","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Healthcare","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":27735,"name":"Numeral","slug":"numeral","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/5df7f1d45531872192d818b74fecda11c470028c.png","website":"https://numeralhq.com/","all_locations":"San Francisco, CA, USA","long_description":"Numeral handles all aspects of sales tax from registration to remittance for e-commerce stores.
