It's often hard to gain adoption due to complicated installs and near impossible to get users to upgrade their version once the product has shipped. Tsumobi hopes to solve this problem by creating their own language. The new language will sit on top of J2ME and process applications downloaded (via URL) for Tsumobi enabled sites. This means that developers will be able to change Tsumobi applications on the fly and have Tsumobi enabled phones automatically get the updates just by visiting a link.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Messaging.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Messaging","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}}],"nbHits":13,"page":0,"nbPages":1,"hitsPerPage":1000,"facets":{"batch":{"W07":13},"status":{"Acquired":6,"Inactive":5,"Active":2},"regions":{"America / Canada":12,"United States of America":12,"Partly Remote":2,"Remote":2,"Unspecified":1},"isHiring":{"false":13},"nonprofit":{"false":13},"industries":{"Consumer":7,"Social":4,"B2B Software and Services":3,"Content":2,"Industrials":2,"Manufacturing and Robotics":2,"Consumer Finance":1,"Financial Technology":1,"Home and Personal":1,"Infrastructure":1,"Marketing":1,"Productivity":1},"subindustry":{"Consumer -> Social":4,"Consumer -> Content":2,"Industrials -> Manufacturing and Robotics":2,"B2B Software and Services -> Infrastructure":1,"B2B Software and Services -> Marketing":1,"B2B Software and Services -> Productivity":1,"Consumer -> Home and Personal":1,"Financial Technology -> Consumer Finance":1},"top_company":{"false":11,"true":2}},"exhaustiveFacetsCount":true,"exhaustiveNbHits":true,"exhaustiveTypo":true,"exhaustive":{"facetsCount":true,"nbHits":true,"typo":true},"query":"","params":"hitsPerPage=1000&query=&page=0&facets=%5B%22top_company%22%2C%22isHiring%22%2C%22nonprofit%22%2C%22batch%22%2C%22industries%22%2C%22subindustry%22%2C%22status%22%2C%22regions%22%5D&tagFilters=&facetFilters=%5B%5B%22batch%3AW07%22%5D%5D&restrictIndices=YCCompany_production&tagFilters=%5B%22ycdc_public%22%5D&analyticsTags=%5B%22ycdc%22%5D","index":"YCCompany_production","renderingContent":{},"processingTimeMS":1,"processingTimingsMS":{"afterFetch":{"format":{"total":1},"total":1},"request":{"roundTrip":71},"total":1},"serverTimeMS":1}]}
