We create innovative, thoughtfully-designed, clinically-proven consumer products to help children, and their families, sleep better. \r\n\r\nOur first product, The Sleep Guardian is the only solution for night terrors. Based on our patented, clinically-proven technology, the Sleep Guardian goes under the mattress and uses precisely-timed vibrations to avoid night terror episodes completely. \r\n\r\nThe Sleep Guardian is just the initial product in a suite of smart solutions based on our process: combining a user-centric approach with a clinical understanding of sleep to solve unmet problems in children’s sleep. \r\n\r\nBased in San Francisco, Lully was founded by Dr. Andy Rink, a doctor and father, and Varun Boriah, a medical device entrepreneur. \r\n\r\nLully was spun out of the Stanford Biodesign Fellowship and is backed by Y Combinator, Two Sigma Ventures, Stanford-StartX Fund and Highway1. We’ve partnered with Stanford Sleep and Riley Children’s Hospital in our goal to help families sleep better.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Lully is developing an under-the-mattress technology that precisely…","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}}},{"id":838,"name":"VetPronto","slug":"vetpronto","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"/small_logos/thumb/missing.png","website":"http://vetpronto.com","location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","long_description":"Currently servicing the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Washington DC, Baltimore, Atlanta, New Orleans and Tampa Bay.\n\nVetPronto is a new type of Veterinary Service dedicated to providing the most quality, convenient and transparent veterinary care possible.
