Kestrel wants to make the next big leap in textile science. It’s developing a fabric that responds to cold by flexing to create air pockets that trap heat and keep people warm. But when the air warms up, these pockets collapse so less heat is trapped and people stay cooler. Kestrel already has a letter of intent from Casper to use its materials in bedding. With people spending tons of money on outerwear, athletic clothes, and more, the temperature-reactive technology could find its way into the fabrics that fill our day-to-day life.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Kestrel Materials makes temperature responsive fabrics for bedding…","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}}},{"id":1659,"name":"Modular Science","slug":"modular-science","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"/small_logos/thumb/missing.png","website":"https://www.modularscience.com/","location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","long_description":"","one_liner":"We're making it easier to do sustainable farming.","team_size":2,"tags":[],"top_company":false,"isHiring":false,"nonprofit":false,"batch":"S17","status":"Active","industry":"Industrials","subindustry":"Industrials -> Agriculture","industries":["Industrials","Agriculture"],"regions":["United States","North America"],"objectID":"1659","_highlightResult":{"name":{"value":"Modular Science","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"website":{"value":"https://www.modularscience.com/","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"location":{"value":"San Francisco, CA, USA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"long_description":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"We're making it easier to do sustainable farming.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}}},{"id":1658,"name":"Flowspace","slug":"flowspace","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/df5edb36018d3eb6e512ed3b8865e8c5298dc2ad.png","website":"http://www.flow.space","location":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","long_description":"Flowspace provides on-demand warehousing for businesses.
