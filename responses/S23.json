Today, games have linear gameplay and fixed content which become stale and repetitive for players. Using AI, Glade is pioneering an entirely new genre of games.\r\n\r\nThe first release from Glade will be Cursed Crown, a multiplayer, rogue-lite game with AI generated content and story progression. Players start the game with a character waking up stranded in a prison alongside their party with their memories erased. The players must escape the prison by climbing each floor, discovering new secrets about their past and how they were captured along the way.

Over time, Maven will add additional knowledge areas to the platform to provide an increasingly comprehensive and accurate assessment of a therapeutic opportunity.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"AI-enabled BioPharma Market Intelligence","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Generative AI","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Biotech","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Healthcare","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Enterprise","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Healthcare IT","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":28922,"name":"Egress Health","slug":"egress-health","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/392ff7d64717e95c1b8ca23af91934ffec643fbf.png","website":"https://tryegress.com","all_locations":"San Francisco, CA, USA","long_description":"\r\n","one_liner":"","team_size":2,"highlight_black":true,"highlight_latinx":false,"highlight_women":false,"industry":"Healthcare","subindustry":"B2B -> Analytics","launched_at":1690905553,"tags":["Healthcare","Health Insurance"],"tags_highlighted":[],"top_company":false,"isHiring":false,"nonprofit":false,"batch":"S23","status":"Active","industries":["Healthcare"],"regions":["United States of America","America / Canada"],"stage":"Early","app_video_public":false,"demo_day_video_public":false,"app_answers":null,"question_answers":false,"objectID":"28922","_highlightResult":{"name":{"value":"Egress Health","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"website":{"value":"https://tryegress.com","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"all_locations":{"value":"San Francisco, CA, USA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"long_description":{"value":"\r\n","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Healthcare","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Health Insurance","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":28921,"name":"Surface Labs","slug":"surface-labs","former_names":["Surface"],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/3f28600e18478de8f39664d28cd895d1eb5b463f.png","website":"https://withsurface.com","all_locations":"","long_description":"We’re building intelligent forms designed to help companies collect richer customer data and convert more site visitors to customers through AI-powered content personalization.\r\n\r\nEvery business site has some sort of a Contact Us, Talk to Sales, Request Demo, or other type of intake form designed to collect data from their users.

However, with the increase of renewable energy as a mix of the electricity supply, comes an intermittent and more volatile balance between supply and demand.  With the mass adoption of EVs, the increasingly urgent demand for air conditioning and electrification of heat, overall electricity demand is outpacing the transformation of the grid. \r\n\r\n\r\nElyos Energy is helping to solve the problem of supply and demand with energy flexibility at scale, starting with the 1.6 million commercial buildings in the UK.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur SaaS platform enables large commercial buildings to leverage their distributed energy resources (smart thermostats, HVAC systems, solar, battery) to reduce strain on the grid at hours of peak demand and lower their energy costs.\r\n\r\nWe connect to a range of APIs from smart thermostats, HVAC systems, solar, battery etc. to automate measures of energy consumption reduction and opt-in to national grid demand response events where customers can earn money for energy reduction. By shifting 10% of peak time consumption, we save companies 15% on their electricity bill and reduce their CO2 emissions by 7%.\r\n\r\nElyos Energy is leveraging energy flexibility, at mass-market scale to enable electrification of the energy system.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"The platform for energy flexibility and demand response","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"SaaS","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"B2B","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Climate","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Energy","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"ClimateTech","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":28780,"name":"Mano Health","slug":"mano-health","former_names":["Mano AI","Mano"],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/8b9da8afc4597aab4b97ebe6cfbca8106e73d357.png","website":"","all_locations":"New York, NY, USA","long_description":"","one_liner":"","team_size":2,"highlight_black":false,"highlight_latinx":true,"highlight_women":false,"industry":"B2B","subindustry":"B2B","launched_at":1686714264,"tags":["Artificial Intelligence","SaaS","Health Tech","B2B","Healthcare IT"],"tags_highlighted":[],"top_company":false,"isHiring":false,"nonprofit":false,"batch":"S23","status":"Active","industries":["B2B"],"regions":["United States of America","America / Canada"],"stage":"Early","app_video_public":false,"demo_day_video_public":false,"app_answers":null,"question_answers":false,"objectID":"28780","_highlightResult":{"name":{"value":"Mano Health","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"former_names":[{"value":"Mano AI","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Mano","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"website":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"all_locations":{"value":"New York, NY, USA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"long_description":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Artificial Intelligence","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"SaaS","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Health Tech","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"B2B","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Healthcare IT","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":28779,"name":"Metoro","slug":"metoro","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/5159d88e739b8afe8dabf5775b72b25f800b705c.png","website":"https://metoro.io","all_locations":"London, England, United Kingdom","long_description":"Metoro is the AI-powered production debugger.
