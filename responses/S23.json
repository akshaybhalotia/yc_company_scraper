And, like an airship, it is extremely energy-efficient, enabling it to fly for up to 10 hours at slow speed (22mph) for optimal data collection which represents a range of 220miles. \r\n\r\nToday, energy infrastructure operators struggle with conducting inspections that are simultaneously: massive and precise. HyLight offers a solution to precisely detect issues on the infrastructure at an industrial scale, and all of this without emitting GHGs.\r\n\r\nWe are 4 co-founders experienced in hardware and energy companies with Masters in Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science and Business from the best Engineering and Business School in France.\r\n\r\nWe have developed 5 different flying aircrafts and are preparing a 20k$ pilot program with Enedis, the largest power line companies in Europe. We also have LOIs with energy infrastructure operators worth over $3.5M.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Small unmanned hydrogen airships for long range monitoring","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Hydrogen Energy","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"B2B","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Climate","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Energy","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Big Data","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":28589,"name":"HockeyStack","slug":"hockeystack","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/90725285723955c6a718c11c6de42fac109093c5.png","website":"https://hockeystack.com","all_locations":"San Francisco, CA, USA","long_description":"HockeyStack improves sales outcomes for B2B companies by helping them record and understand every interaction their customers have with their marketing, sales reps, CSMs, and products. \r\n\r\nWe map every customer touchpoint from ad impression to closed won and to upsell using our own tracking script and native integrations to the B2B GTM tech stack. \r\n\r\nBuilding this source of truth allow us to give companies previously hidden insights that generate incremental revenue, such as:\r\n\r\n- Deploy marketing budget: \"Launch this ad campaign to this audience to generate $XM in pipeline\"\r\n- Target the right accounts with the right messaging: \"These accounts have the highest likelihood to convert, put them on this email sequence\"\r\n- Convert more of the pipeline: “Pied Piper hasn't visited the site for 8 days; give Jim a phone call”\r\n","one_liner":"The operating system for inbound B2B revenue","team_size":8,"highlight_black":false,"highlight_latinx":false,"highlight_women":false,"industry":"B2B","subindustry":"B2B -> Sales","launched_at":1680648195,"tags":["SaaS","B2B","Analytics","Sales","Marketing"],"tags_highlighted":[],"top_company":false,"top_company_by_revenue":false,"isHiring":true,"nonprofit":false,"batch":"S23","status":"Active","industries":["B2B","Sales"],"regions":["United States of America","America / Canada","Remote","Partly Remote"],"stage":"Early","app_video_public":false,"demo_day_video_public":false,"app_answers":null,"question_answers":false,"objectID":"28589","_highlightResult":{"name":{"value":"HockeyStack","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"website":{"value":"https://hockeystack.com","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"all_locations":{"value":"San Francisco, CA, USA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"long_description":{"value":"HockeyStack improves sales outcomes for B2B companies by helping them record and understand every interaction their customers have with their marketing, sales reps, CSMs, and products. \r\n\r\nWe map every customer touchpoint from ad impression to closed won and to upsell using our own tracking script and native integrations to the B2B GTM tech stack. \r\n\r\nBuilding this source of truth allow us to give companies previously hidden insights that generate incremental revenue, such as:\r\n\r\n- Deploy marketing budget: \"Launch this ad campaign to this audience to generate $XM in pipeline\"\r\n- Target the right accounts with the right messaging: \"These accounts have the highest likelihood to convert, put them on this email sequence\"\r\n- Convert more of the pipeline: “Pied Piper hasn't visited the site for 8 days; give Jim a phone call”\r\n","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"The operating system for inbound B2B revenue","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"SaaS","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"B2B","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Analytics","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Sales","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Marketing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":28486,"name":"Can of Soup","slug":"can-of-soup","former_names":["Emittance"],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/656e2a84daf650d3d12f4a1b2f1c994879a2d1df.png","website":"https://canofsoup.com/","all_locations":"","long_description":"Can of Soup is an app where you can use AI to create photos of you and your friends in imaginary situations.
