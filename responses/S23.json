We configure cold email infrastructure to maximize email deliverability. Our product will automatically configure your DNS records, warm up your emails (email warmup), orchestrate emails to send optimally across all your accounts, run multi-layer email bounce detection (email waterfall), and modify each outgoing cold outreach to ensure your cold outbound sales emails don't trigger spam filters.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond, we automate sales lead generation with dynamic audiences (AI powered sales assistant, AI based SDR). We have B2B company data on 60 million B2B companies and 800 million B2B contacts, sourced from dozens of data providers (i.e. think sources like BuiltWith, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, SemRush, Apollo data, and more). This allows you to precisely segment your audience by the companies you care about and exclude everyone else. Our audiences are dynamic (i.e., account based marketing, account based sales, ABM), meaning we continuously look for prospects matching your targeting criteria and add them to your audience to run our automated outbound sales sequences. This automates manual workflows you might be running on platforms like Clay or Persana. You can also create an audience once based on intent signals (i.e., GTM or go-to-market signals, sales intelligence) and put your outreach on autopilot.\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, our AI sales copilot (AI sales agent, AI based BDR) enables AI powered hyper-personalized emails that boost response rates. The biggest debate in sales is choosing between relevancy and personalization—now you don’t have to. We search far and wide to find the “golden nugget” of information to connect with your prospect, and then use GPT-4 to write hyper personalized email sequences that dramatically increase reply rates and book meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of these core differences, we stand out from competitors. Products like apollo io have poor email deliverability rates that ruin email health long-term. Existing email outbound tools like amplemarket, reply io, marketo, and outreach io don't scale well and restrict you to small volumes of outbound emails. AI features to autopilot campaigns are missing in products like smartlead ai, instantly, unify gtm, penguin ai, and warmly ai. Currently, our philosophy is to allow AI to 100-1000x your team's output while maintaining extremely high email quality. AI sales copilots like reggie ai, aisdr, artisan ai / artisan sdr / artisan bdr, and others let gpt use AI to generate the entire email, which results in poor outbound email quality since SDRs/BDRs don't have fine-tune controls on the personalization.","one_liner":"We automate SDR / BDR prospecting & outbound sales workflows using AI","team_size":8,"industry":"B2B","subindustry":"B2B","launched_at":1689840885,"tags":["Artificial Intelligence","Generative AI","SaaS","B2B","Sales"],"tags_highlighted":[],"top_company":false,"isHiring":false,"nonprofit":false,"batch":"S23","status":"Active","industries":["B2B"],"regions":["United States of America","America / Canada"],"stage":"Early","app_video_public":false,"demo_day_video_public":false,"app_answers":null,"question_answers":false,"objectID":"29074","_highlightResult":{"name":{"value":"Fiber AI","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"website":{"value":"https://fiber.ai/","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"all_locations":{"value":"San Francisco, CA, USA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"long_description":{"value":"Fiber AI automates SDR and BDR prospecting & outbound sales workflows using AI.

Products like apollo io have poor email deliverability rates that ruin email health long-term. Existing email outbound tools like amplemarket, reply io, marketo, and outreach io don't scale well and restrict you to small volumes of outbound emails. AI features to autopilot campaigns are missing in products like smartlead ai, instantly, unify gtm, penguin ai, and warmly ai. Currently, our philosophy is to allow AI to 100-1000x your team's output while maintaining extremely high email quality. AI sales copilots like reggie ai, aisdr, artisan ai / artisan sdr / artisan bdr, and others let gpt use AI to generate the entire email, which results in poor outbound email quality since SDRs/BDRs don't have fine-tune controls on the personalization.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"We automate SDR / BDR prospecting & outbound sales workflows using AI","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Artificial Intelligence","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Generative AI","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"SaaS","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"B2B","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Sales","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":29073,"name":"OpsBerry AI","slug":"opsberry-ai","former_names":["Monitaur","Monitaur (Pivoted)"],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/900e1fd6b92213c81a8b2615f9bd03b24a29a685.png","website":"https://opsberry.ai","all_locations":"Remote","long_description":"OpsBerry AI defends against human and non-human identity breaches using AI to continuously discover, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities in your identity sprawl.
