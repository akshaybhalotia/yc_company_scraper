Some are great at getting you to where you want to go, others are great for answering your questions, and a few are good for research. If you're looking for something on a social media platform, searching is even more difficult, with the search features of these platforms often failing to guide users effectively, leading them to creatively use traditional search engines by adding terms like 'reddit' to their queries to uncover more relevant results. This “hacky” solution only searches Reddit when a more accurate answer or crucial context may lie somewhere else that currently requires additional searches to find. Moreover, the prevalence of misinformation adds another layer of complexity, as unverified data and prioritized SEO-driven results can mislead users.\r\n\r\nLLMs have enabled the automatic ingestion and understanding of huge amounts of information. Instead of summarizing links from existing search techniques, our approach is to use LLMs to build our index.

Some are great at getting you to where you want to go, others are great for answering your questions, and a few are good for research. If you're looking for something on a social media platform, searching is even more difficult, with the search features of these platforms often failing to guide users effectively, leading them to creatively use traditional search engines by adding terms like 'reddit' to their queries to uncover more relevant results. This “hacky” solution only searches Reddit when a more accurate answer or crucial context may lie somewhere else that currently requires additional searches to find.

Our patented drugs starve cancer by removing this heme that cancer cells need, but normal cells don’t.

Alongside our core business, we're leading cutting-edge research into how to create the most functional and human-like digital workers with Artisan Labs. \r\n\r\nOur first Artisan, Ava, automates the entire outbound sales process and can be set up with a 10-minute conversation. Ava creates TCPs, prospects with her database of over 270,000,000 contacts, crafts & sends highly bespoke email sequences, and books meetings into your calendar. And, you can manage all features & settings by talking to Ava via Slack. \r\n\r\nWe're not creating another SaaS product for teams to use, we're creating new team members. \r\n\r\nThis is the next Industrial Revolution.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Creating the first human-like digital workers, called Artisans","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"SaaS","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"B2B","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Workflow Automation","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Sales","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"AI","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":29294,"name":"Octolane AI","slug":"octolane-ai","former_names":["OctoLane","Octolane"],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/e1b7263f99b5954191087c85582bb6d188d6bba1.png","website":"https://www.octolane.com","all_locations":"San Francisco, CA, USA","long_description":"We’re building the first sales CRM that can actually find customers and book sales calls with them for you.
