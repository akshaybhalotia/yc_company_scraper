After the call, they'd have to explain the product to other decision-makers on their team who were not on the call in order to determine if they wanted to proceed with the vendor.\r\n\r\nHowever, they would often forget important information and do a much poorer job of communicating the value propositions of the vendor compared to the sales rep, which caused deals to slow down or stop entirely. This problem cost sellers $10k-$500k+ per deal.\r\n\r\nSales reps wanted to show highlights from the call so everyone could get the same experience of being on the original call without having to sit through the entire call. This is why the founders started Mica.\r\n\r\nBy using Mica, sales teams have seen increases in conversion rates and faster sales cycles.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Turn Sales Calls Into Personalized Video Shorts For Prospects","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Artificial Intelligence","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"SaaS","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Sales","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Sales Enablement","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"AI","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":29965,"name":"Formula Insight","slug":"formula-insight","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/0d24f87db5131a298b5fd35aba59870c07522d6f.png","website":"https://www.formulainsight.io/","all_locations":"","long_description":"We are building a central repository for hedge funds to store their most valuable Excel data that can be accessed with conversational search.","one_liner":"Search complex spreadsheets using plain english","team_size":2,"highlight_black":false,"highlight_latinx":false,"highlight_women":false,"industry":"B2B","subindustry":"B2B","launched_at":1721802502,"tags":["SaaS","B2B","Workflow Automation","Productivity","Enterprise Software"],"tags_highlighted":[],"top_company":false,"isHiring":false,"nonprofit":false,"batch":"S24","status":"Active","industries":["B2B"],"regions":["Unspecified"],"stage":"Early","app_video_public":false,"demo_day_video_public":false,"app_answers":null,"question_answers":false,"objectID":"29965","_highlightResult":{"name":{"value":"Formula Insight","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"website":{"value":"https://www.formulainsight.io/","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"all_locations":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"long_description":{"value":"We are building a central repository for hedge funds to store their most valuable Excel data that can be accessed with conversational search.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Search complex spreadsheets using plain english","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"SaaS","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"B2B","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Workflow Automation","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Productivity","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Enterprise Software","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":29964,"name":"Overlap","slug":"overlap","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/4998b9bdb179ae20d8af8c2a3631f5ca038a41d2.png","website":"https://www.joinoverlap.com/","all_locations":"","long_description":"","one_liner":"A new podcast app that uses AI to curate the best moments for you.","team_size":3,"highlight_black":false,"highlight_latinx":false,"highlight_women":false,"industry":"Consumer","subindustry":"Consumer -> Content","launched_at":1721766905,"tags":["Consumer","Media","Podcasts","AI"],"tags_highlighted":[],"top_company":false,"isHiring":false,"nonprofit":false,"batch":"S24","status":"Active","industries":["Consumer","Content"],"regions":["Unspecified"],"stage":"Early","app_video_public":false,"demo_day_video_public":false,"app_answers":null,"question_answers":false,"objectID":"29964","_highlightResult":{"name":{"value":"Overlap","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"website":{"value":"https://www.joinoverlap.com/","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"all_locations":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"long_description":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"A new podcast app that uses AI to curate the best moments for you.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Consumer","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Media","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Podcasts","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"AI","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":29962,"name":"Kart AI","slug":"kart-ai","former_names":["Omni"],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/26d03427ec3ea68c07451c35b4d65e5adcaa30cc.png","website":"https://kart.ai","all_locations":"San Francisco, CA, USA","long_description":"We are an interactive search platform that helps you find and compare electronic products.

Companies like Lull.com and Dutch.com are using our development toolkit to increase their bottom line by automating internal processes and elevating their consumer’s experiences. You don’t need AI Engineers, you just need to understand your business.\r\n\r\nAlex and Tyler met at a high-growth E-Commerce startup where Tyler was on the operating team running Technology & Analytics. Together, they built AI products that bootstrapped the company profitably to over $100MM in Revenue.\r\n\r\nAlex experienced firsthand the broken developer experience in AI while building enterprise infrastructure at Yardi. Even with a dedicated ML team, it took too much time to build simple chatbots. It was clear that if large companies were struggling with this, SMBs would definitely be left behind. We went directly to our network of SMB operators and found our hunch was correct.

Instead of manually crafting prompts, developers can integrate Zenbase AI’s open-source SDK to streamline and optimize their AI workflows. Imagine working on an AI project where the prompt engineering process is automated, reducing your workload and improving efficiency.\r\n\r\nZenbase AI is transforming how developers ship with AI by providing automated prompt engineering and continuous quality optimization. Zenbase AI enables you to create better user experiences faster, focusing on programming rather than prompting. With Zenbase AI, you can drive better outcomes and save dozens of hours.\r\n\r\nCyrus Nouroozi and Amir Mehr have been friends for a long time and have been doing consulting together. Both are key contributors to StanfordNLP's DSPy project. Through their consulting work, they identified a common pain point: prompt iteration was time-consuming with uncertain ROI. Realizing the potential for automation, they created Zenbase. By automating prompt engineering, Zenbase significantly reduces the time and effort required, allowing developers to deploy AI models faster and with better performance.\r\n\r\nZenbase, being open-source, empowers a wide range of developers and companies to enhance their AI capabilities efficiently.
