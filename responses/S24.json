We achieve this accuracy by constraining our genAI-based simulations to obey the laws of physics, avoiding the hallucinations seen in other GenAI technologies.\r\n\r\nSince joining YC, Angstrom AI has developed the first physically accurate gen-AI based simulation of multiple molecules interacting.

We achieve this accuracy by constraining our genAI-based simulations to obey the laws of physics, avoiding the hallucinations seen in other GenAI technologies.\r\n\r\nSince joining YC, Angstrom AI has developed the first physically accurate gen-AI based simulation of multiple molecules interacting.
