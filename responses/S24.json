On the other hand, nearly half of all truck space goes unused annually in the $900B+ US trucking industry. \r\n\r\nWith trucking being a hyper-fragmented market (90%+ of US trucking companies are small family businesses), we decided to build an ecosystem that takes all of this inefficiency and turns it into something that could fundamentally transform the livelihoods of businesses and drivers alike.\r\n\r\nOway is designed to be simple (you can place an order in 30 seconds) and scale with your business. Our ML rideshare protocol now allows businesses to ship freight affordably and faster than ever before.

We have struggled with existing technologies, creating complex manual workflows that are time-consuming to maintain for installing, updating, and configuring packages.\r\n\r\n‎ \r\nCurrently, we are focused on the user experience, aiming to save engineers as much time as possible by building on top of existing technologies. In the future, we plan to develop an entirely new packaging and bundling format for all cloud-native packages, providing a straightforward way to install and configure packages, offering simple upgrade paths, and enabling feedback, crash reports, and analytics, similar to how Android supports Play Store developers.\r\n\r\n\r\n‎ With Glasskube, we are transforming the cloud-native ecosystem by developing a new standard that simplifies package management, similar to systems like macOS's Homebrew or npm. Our big-picture goal with Glasskube is to build enterprise-ready infrastructure software running mission-critical workloads in every one of the more than 3 million Kubernetes clusters globally.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"The next generation Package Manager for Kubernetes","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Developer Tools","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"B2B","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Open Source","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Kubernetes","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"DevOps","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":29585,"name":"Mem0","slug":"mem0","former_names":["Embedchain Inc","Embedchain"],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/56ef3ec5ae83019ddb5d6898272fd3b9d1089c62.png","website":"https://mem0.ai","all_locations":"Mountain View, CA, USA","long_description":"At Mem0, we are building the long-term memory for LLMs to enable personalization for the GenAI stack.
