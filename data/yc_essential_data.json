Our vision is to develop non-hormonal contraceptives to provide both women and men with birth control options that lack the associated risks of hormone-based options but are equally effective. Traditionally, it has been the women’s financial and health burden to have a contraceptive in place. Our first goal is therefore to  bring a novel non-hormonal, on-demand and low cost female contraceptive to the market that will substantially improve their quality of life and well-being. Our second goal is to develop the first ever non-surgical and highly effective non-hormonal contraceptive for men. Currently, male contraception is limited to two main options – vasectomy or condoms. Having such options available to both women and men will globally allow for much better family planning, reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies including abortions and therefore reduce costs and ensure contraceptive health and well-being.",

We believe it doesn’t have to be that way. That’s why we built Numero, a modern financial platform that Democratic elected officials and candidates at all levels of public office can use to manage the $4.5 billion in annual contributions to their political campaigns.\r\n\r\nThere’s been a 40% increase in the number of people running for office in recent years. Inspired by the current state of politics, people from every background imaginable have stepped up to run, including our CEO, Brian, who ran for Congress in 2018. Our other two co-founders, Susie and Karan, led the finance and technology arms of his campaign. They learned firsthand the painful process of manually stitching together critical finance and compliance data using outdated campaign software.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to change that painful process and liberate hard-working candidates, campaign staffs, and volunteers, letting them focus on their most important work: talking with voters and representing their constituents in their communities.\r\n\r\nIn our first two years, we’ve already helped more than 200 campaigns raise $832 million. And there’s much more room for us to grow. The US has more than 500,000 elected officials, and many more candidates run for office at all levels of government. ",

Their technology is outdated, their source code proprietary and their security vulnerabilities – described in detail by the security community over many years – are left unpatched. It’s not surprising that 76% of voters are concerned that our elections are vulnerable to hacking. And if voters lose trust in elections, then the very foundation of our democracy is at risk.\r\n\r\nWe’re using open-source software, off-the-shelf hardware, and modern product engineering to make elections dramatically safer, more accessible, and more affordable.

The sequence we produce will be of unprecedented accuracy due to several layers of in-built redundancy including the sequencing both strands of the double-helix concurrently. The sequence we produce will be complete, encompassing: structural as well as single nucleotide variants; long-range haplotype phase; the repetitive \"dark matter\" of the genome. The cost of goods (consumables) of sequencing will be <$10, which will allow us to price our product at a level that will help grow the market while still achieving >90% margin.

Through a 10-minute breath test with the PNOĒ mask we offer you the most personalized diet and workout plan as well as a complete assessment of your cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. Cardio-metabolic analysis is considered the most insightful non-invasive health assessment since it measures how the metabolic, cardiovascular and pulmonary systems operated individually but also in unison. However, despite its great utility in fitness and health, cardio-metabolic analysis has long been restricted to very few fitness and medical centers due to the cost, size, and complexity of traditional cardio-metabolic analyzers. PNOĒ is changing that with the first portable, low cost, and medical grade cardio-metabolic analyzer which comes with a data interpretation service, allowing anyone from a personal trainer to a cardiologist to apply cardio-metabolic analysis in his practice without the need for specialized skills. \r\n\r\nOur team has extensive experience in gas sensing technologies, cardio-metabolic analysis, nutrition and physical exercise prescription, cardiovascular & pulmonary disease diagnosis and hardware development (firmware, electrical engineering, mechanical design).  \r\n\r\nWe are on a mission to make cardio-metabolic analysis the health checkup of the future and we are excited to get in touch with anyone who believes he can help. Our initial approach was to start by making cardio-metabolic analysis accessible to the world of competitive fitness but very quickly saw great interest from the general population fitness and wellness market. As a result, our current focus is to offer cardio-metabolic analysis as a diet/physical exercise prescription as well cardiovascular/pulmonary disease prevention tool in fitness & wellness centers. In this direction, we are deploying PNOĒ in as many fitness & wellness centers as possible (i.e. gyms, boutique studios, private clinics, wellness retreats, corporate wellness centers etc.) so support through introductions and recommendations is highly appreciated. \r\n\r\nAreas of particular interest include: Health, wellness, fitness, wearables and gas sensing technologies.

Five of these reactors are 45-65 years old and are quickly coming to the end of their operational life. This has cultivated a fragile and lengthy supply chain, at odds with the nature of radioactive material.\r\n\r\nThis issue and its implications do not just effect molybdenum, but any other reactor-based isotope. Many promising cancer therapies are stuck in clinical trials, unable to secure enough material in a timely manner. Research doesn’t even happen because of the difficulty of sourcing any new isotopes.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't have to be this way. Atomic Alchemy is working to solve this by building the world's first scalable radioisotope production facility.

It does this by constantly indexing live updates from services including Twitter, Flickr, Digg, Delicious and more. When users search for a topic on Scoopler, they get the most relevant results, updated in real-time.\n\nScoopler has now become JustSpotted, a celebrity-tracking tool, meant to give fans an idea of what their favorite celebrities are up to at any given moment. JustSpotted, like Scoopler, is a data-aggregator, yet JustSpotted collects from Twitter, Facebook, and Foursquare -- alongside their own data theyâ€™ll be collecting from users who actual spot celebrities in the wild. All the information we aggregate is publicly available and you can even do a search on Twitter yourself and find sightings of celebrities. We're just the first people to organize it on a map and in such a way that it's easy to consume and ENJOY.â€\n\nJustSpotted is about connecting with celebs. All the sightings on our website are naturally occurring events where an everyday person bumps into a celebrity as a chance occurrence. Back in the day, when you saw a celebrity while you were out and about the first thing you would have done was phone or text a friend. In the new age of social media, the first thing you do is share it on Facebook or Twitter. This phenomena is already happening.\n\nThe service, which launches the week of October 11, 2010, is the latest creation by AJ Asver, Dilan Jarawardane and Benjamin Tauber.",

In order to afford utilities, families often forgo medication, food, and transportation.

Nomiku led the way for people to use it at home in 2012 with the invention of the home sous vide immersion circulator funded by two successful Kickstarter projects totaling over $1.3M raised. They turned this modernist gadget into a useful everyday kitchen tool by dramatically reducing the price of the machine and redesigning it from the bottom up for at-home functionality. Five years later, the sous vide machine is turning into a mainstream darling and the advent of the Nomiku Sous Chef Meal delivery program (launching on May 15, 2017) breaks the last barriers to make sous vide accessible to everybody.\r\n \r\nThe Nomiku Sous Chef launch comes at the heels of Samsung Ventures participating in an investment round in the startup.

At Booktrope we do not charge authors to publish nor do we accept all submissions.\n\nWe have pioneered a concept called “Team Publishing” which addresses the way books are actually developed, not just the way they are distributed and read. We offer print, ebook, and web versions of all our books, in other words, we are format agnostic. We don’t want to debate the death of print books, or the birth of ebooks, we love and support them all. \n\nA typical Publishing Team consists of an author, editor, designer and business/marketing manager for the book. You don’t get assigned projects in our system; you choose the people you work with.  We work much more quickly than traditional publishers, taking advantage of new technologies to streamline the process of getting books into the hands of readers. Lastly, we use that same technology to keep overhead low, and we think that the bulk of the revenue from book sales should go back to the creative team that makes them happen.",

With sequencing and synthesis being mainstream now [1], 20n provides the computational systems that predict DNA design for novel industrial biotech and health applications.\n\nAt 20n, we are taking a fresh look at turning biological data into information. We approach it as a big data learning problem, and bring to bear techniques from machine learning, distributed systems, AI planning, program synthesis, data mining, and natural language processing. With the support of DARPA [2], we are building a team of computer scientists, and bioengineers to look at biology in fundamentally new ways.\n\nOur current customers include industrial biotech firms that are leading the charge in transitioning us from traditional unsustainable means of manufacturing to sustainable biological processes leading to advanced fuels, materials, therapeutics, and flavors and fragrances. 20n’s technology helps them enter markets previously thought inaccessible for biology.\n\n[1] Sequencing DNA costs $4k/genome (http://www.genome.gov/sequencingcosts/) and is expected to go down to $1k/genome. Synthesizing DNA is at 20cents/bp, and is expected to go down to 0.1cents/bp.\n[2] DARPA in the past supported work that led to the internet, stealth planes, GPS, and even Douglas Engelbart’s mother-of-all-demos.",

By providing a home try on program and giving the ability to make custom fit adjustments to all of their apparel, Vastrm allows its customers to finally hone in on and find the perfect fit for their unique body types.\r\n\r\nTang came up with the idea for Vastrm, which is a Sanskrit word for cloth, when a customer told him he had purchased a perfect shirt in Italy and has never been able to find the same fit again. He was considering flying back to Italy to track the shirt maker down, but Jonathan managed to adjust Vastrm shirts to the same fit.",

There was no press release related to this event but it's assumed the company was acquired.\n\nSending and receiving payments through TextPayMe is easy: simply write a text message to SMS@TextPayMe.com with \"pay amount phonenumber\" in the body (i.e. to send $5 to 123-456-7890, text \"pay 5 1234567890\"). The service is secure as well, as each payment needs to be confirmed by a user-created PIN. To fund your transactions, TextPayMe lets you add money directly from your bank account and now also lets you link your credit card as well.

We replace this hardware with lightweight software that enables customized product selection and seamless checkout. Offices no longer need to sully their breakrooms with unsightly machines selling stale snacks; rather, they can enjoy the clean and minimal retail look of our Yumbins chock full of delicious products. \r\n\r\nInitially, we are targeting workplaces where employees pay for snacks, which are the large majority of corporate offices and manufacturing facilities. 1.2M of these sites fall into our target market, of which roughly 50% have vending machines today.",

These reviews and votes can be cast from the site's iPhone app or from the service's homepage. The homepage also features a stream of the latest comments to come in from other users, as well as a profile for each restaurant in the system that includes all of its votes and comments. There's also a nifty feature that lets you view a heatmap of your current region, so you can quickly figure out the hot spots in town.\n\nThe gameplay in GraffitiGeo gives you points for checking into certain locations, similar to FourSquare, but doesn't really let you do anything with them. With GraffitiGeo, you earn points for every action you take, be it voting on a restaurant or leaving a brief comment. Once you've reached a certain point threshold, you can use those points to start a \"mob\", which you can invite your friends to join. Mobs allow friends to pool their points, which can then be used to acquire territory, which corresponds to actual city blocks. Whenever someone votes on one of the restaurants on the block, the mob gets some street cred too. It's definitely going to be confusing at first, but it also brings a team element to gameplay.",

Their mission is to have a positive impact on the environment, local communities, and the housing crisis through their sustainable approach.\r\n\r\nMighty Buildings' technology has the potential to unlock the needed productivity for large scale construction alongside the opportunity for reduced emissions, leading to a more sustainable product and future. Mighty Buildings was founded by a team of physicists and robotics engineers with extensive experience solving hard R&D problems and building successful engineering firms. They started by inventing a new material that is a 3D printing tech that enabled printing of an entire building, not just walls, in a single cycle. Unlike concrete, Mighty Buildings’ material is lighter, can be uniquely treated (trimmed and cut) by robotic arms, and features high thermal insulation properties. This allows them to produce prefab housing with up to 80% of operations automated.\r\n\r\nMighty Buildings has a near-zero waste production process, preventing 1,100 - 2,000 kg of CO2 emission per 3D-printed home. They are committed to achieving Net-Zero by 2028 - making the company 22 years ahead of the construction industry.\r\n\r\nThe company is certified under California's Factory Built Housing program to build units using 3D-printing, but they are also the first company to achieve certification under the UL 3401 standard for evaluating building structures and assemblies.",

Our cornerstone product, Humidifeye, is an ophthalmic platform to treat dry eye disease. Dry eye affects more than 25 million Americans and the global treatment market is projected higher than $6 Billion within the next decade. Our thermally responsive, form-fitting materials are suitable for sustained yet reversible occlusion across a range of treatment times. In contrast to existing technologies, our product will not extrude, or cause discomfort as it adapts to patients. Though Humidifeye is not yet FDA approved, expect to hear about it soon!\r\n\r\nIn coordination with partners across several sectors, we have a variety of groundbreaking technologies in the works that live up to our vision. This work has already been recognized. AesculaTech was named a Rosenman Innovator, received a National Science Foundation I-Corps grant, was a finalist in the 2019 Octane High Tech Awards, and is a graduate of both the Y Combinator and TMCx accelerator programs.

The leading gum is sold like a pharmaceutical drug, with flavoring and packaging to match. Vapes provide a cumbersome, over-the-top experience — with use as tightly restricted as cigarette smoking itself, but more juvenile, conspicuous, and highly addictive. People want, and deserve, a better way.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we want to deliver nicotine users a superior experience, and at the same time give them a way to transition out of feeling dependent. In a better society, people wouldn’t carry around the sensation that they’re stuck with an involuntary habit. Our mission isn’t to encourage nicotine use among people who haven’t started. Unlike certain vapes or other products, ours isn’t the sort coveted by underage users on social media. Our mission is to alleviate the harm related to tobacco — first and foremost, by switching people away from the most harmful products.\r\n\r\nSo, at Lucy, we take an evidence based view of nicotine. Nicotine’s pleasurable properties make it an inevitable part of modern society. Therefore, minimizing harm in all nicotine products is key, in addition to giving people products and strategies for cessation. We feel that, as 1,300 people are dying of tobacco related illnesses every day in the US, the most important and immediate step toward a better society is giving nicotine consumers products they enjoy using that will cause less harm.\r\n\r\nOur first product is designed to appeal to smokers and encourage them to switch. And, looking ahead, we hope to secure approval in the future as a clinically proven smoking cessation aid, while continuing to participate in the FDA’s public hearings around how NRTs are best regulated. Our goals are simple: because harm reduction is a better strategy around nicotine delivery than abstinence or prohibition, we want to help improve public health — and reduce its costs — through a superior pure nicotine product.",

Such attorneys usually have more flexible hours, lower rates, and greater interest in customer service than to their larger firm counterparts. The problem is that there is so many such lawyers; how is someone supposed to figure out who is right for them, and who has some time to take on their case? Fair question. Coincidentally, we started Lawdingo to answer just that. \n\nIf you're looking for a lawyer, we encourage you to try finding an easier way to get one to work for you. If you are a lawyer working in solo or small practice, we encourage you to find a more effective way to grow your law practice. \n\nWe also encourage you not to take our word for it. Read what Solo Practice University, the ABA Journal, FindLaw, AboveTheLaw, TechCrunch, Lifehacker, and others say about us. This isn't some fly-by-the-night company. This is the future of the legal industry. We hope you'll get in touch. \n\nLawdingo was started by Nikhil Nirmel (nikhil@lawdingo.com), an entrepreneur with a background at Yelp and Wharton Undergrad, and Dan Langevin , a ridiculously talented technologist who was formerly CTO of Lifebooker.

Coin 2.0 lets you swipe or tap your cards at millions of merchants across the USA. Coin 2.0 has 80%+ compatibility, partly because we use cutting-edge technology that has not yet been integrated into all point-of-sale systems. We encourage customers to carry a “backup card” given the wide variety of sales registers in the USA. While Coin 2.0 shares the same form factor as a credit card, it features enhancements such as an electronic display and a single button to allow for simple switching between different cards. With over-the-air updates, Coin 2.0 adapts to evolving payment technology, offering future-ready ubiquity in a small and powerful package. Coin's security features also keep your information safe. Auto-unlock means that only you can use your Coin 2.0 while Last Known Location helps you find your Coin 2.0 in case of loss or theft. Coin 2.0 is designed for use in the USA.

Then they wait to get a \"backpack request\" and ask their price. Finally, they confirm the deal, buy the items, deliver them and earn money. Shoppers on the other hand, search items from their favorite websites and fill out the item description. Then they give their location and find a traveler coming to their city. Finally they \"request backpack\" and confirm the deal. Within days they can get the product and save money.  \n\nbackpack is founded with a vision to provide every citizen of the world with a choice; the choice of buying organic, authentic, and cost effective products with minimum friction.\nWhether the product is state-of-the-art consumer electronics, exotic pashmina from the south-east, or even medication that are rare in some parts of the world and not so rare in others - we promise ourselves to get those products to your doorsteps.

You deserve free and powerful everyday banking.\n\nNearly 3 out of 4 millennials would rather go to the dentist than listen to their bank. While it's possible that we just really love our oral hygiene, it's more likely that we don't trust or like our banks.\n\nIt's not hard to understand why. Big banks use big budgets and armies of salespeople and marketers to sell old-school products layered with fees and penalties. Their profits increase when we spend more, overuse debt, and make mistakes like overdrafting.\n\nBig banks get away with this because banking is such a vital service. Everyday spending and saving decisions that begin at the checking account ultimately determine whether we'll lead a healthy and secure financial life.\n\nWhat can be done? Bill Gates believes banks aren't necessary for banking. Millennials believe technology companies can make banking better. So let's build a better bank.

Through a secure, HIPAA-compliant platform, our service connects users with a carefully curated team of wellness professionals.

Our web-based approach offers valuable guidance through accessible and anonymous means. Users log in to secure accounts and speak with licensed professionals on a variety of topics—relationship conflict, job stress, etc.—from anywhere at any time. With our proprietary technology, we have removed every barrier to entry and created an outlet for millions who wouldn’t have sought emotional health services otherwise, reducing stress for an increasingly stressed-out generation. This is the future of mental health. \n\nThe shift in moving counseling services online is inevitable and our product is already in demand: After a successful pilot with Pretty Padded Room, an online therapy website specifically targeted towards millennial women, we are excited to relaunch as In Your Corner, an aspirational brand that provides the very best in counseling, coaching, and calm. In Your Corner improves on our original offering by being more gender-inclusive and convenient. In addition to developing a mobile app to provide one-tap, on-demand support in real time, users also have access not only to licensed mental health counselors, but also coaches in personal and professional development as well as instructors of meditation and breath work.",

We combine unique electroceramic materials, nanofabrication techniques, and biologically plausible models of learning to create the Memristive Nanowire Neural Network (MN3), a new type of AI chip.

But, today, plant-based dairy is prohibitively expensive due to the use of nuts as the primary ingredient. \r\n \r\nI created Spero (sperofoods.co) because I wanted everyone to be able to eat clean dairy alternatives that actually taste good. So, I leveraged my background in engineering, chemistry, and art to develop Spero's patent-pending formulations and brand.\r\n \r\nAt Spero, we make dairy from seeds. \r\n \r\nWhy seeds? Almonds/cashews (nuts), which comprise the majority of the dairy alternatives industry today, will never create cost comparable products with dairy because they are too expensive and they're hard to scale. They take too much time, space, water, and human labor. Seeds are 7-8x less expensive and grow 50-70x faster than nuts.\r\n \r\nSpero owns exclusive rights to the technology needed to transform seeds into dairy alternatives. Not only does our pending-patent cover novel processing techniques for cheeses, but it’s comprehensive for all dairy alternatives, including milk, creamers, yogurt, and even eggs.\r\n \r\nBy using truly scalable ingredients and cutting-edge technology, Spero will be the first company to make plant-based dairy cheaper than traditional dairy products. Spero will be the first company to make dairy alternatives mainstream.\r\n \r\nRecent Press:\r\nIAB’s Most Disruptive Brands in the U.S.\r\nForbes Under 30 Most Innovative Startups\r\nTED Women Food Trends\r\nWinter Fancy Food Show Standout Startup\r\n",

This control over smooth muscle tissues allows the surgeon to identify hidden anatomic structures (ureters, sphincters and others), determine tissue health, and even assist in diagnosing disease states. The technology is delivered through the surgeon's existing instruments (which have remained unchanged in over 30 years) giving a completely new capability to the surgeon while maintaining seamless workflow integration.\r\n\r\nWith an $600M (and growing)  initial market, the technology is future-proof and is readily able to be integrated into the continued advancements in the surgical space.",

By removing Uber/Lyft’s 25% commission plus booking fee, Nomad drivers earn ~20% more, while riders pay ~20% less. Instead, Nomad monetizes through monthly driver subscriptions, in-car advertising, and in-car vending machines. One investor described us as the Salesforce of the Gig Economy where we sell software as a service (SaaS) to each driver. It’s the driver’s business, Nomad just sells them the software.\r\n\r\nIn our first 68 days of operation, Nomad has grown explosively. We have received over 9,450 ride requests from our 3,700+ users. We had over 1,000 ride requests in a single day as riders have grown obsessed with our service. Some of our top riders have requested 100+ rides since they have downloaded the app. We have coded the entire driver and rider apps ourselves and have reached the point where demand is far outstripping supply. We have thousands of paying, die-hard customers who tell us they love Nomad over Uber and Lyft. They say they feel safer and love our price point.\r\n\r\nOur service is currently focused on serving large college towns and Midwestern cities.",

A group shopping app where people can shop together with their friends on WhatsApp and Facebook and get huge discounts.\r\n\r\nRemember when your first Flipkart order arrived? You went through hundreds of products in their website, chose one that you liked, mostly cheaper than you could have gotten it in any offline shop (if it was available in an offline shop that is), and it shows up at your door. Remember that delight? There are 800 million Indians who are yet to experience that. So far, eCommerce in India has been only making inroads in the top income decile of the population. The price points for most products in eCommerce sites are largely out of bounds for the majority Indian population. There was no economically feasible way to sell low priced goods (think 200Rs shirt) to the rest of the population over internet. With WhatsApp and Facebook, group buying is just a click away. And because we can accumulate a large amount of orders for the same product this way, the prices go down significantly. Making it finally possible to sell a 200Rs shirt online and still have a positive unit economics. THIS is how we think eCommerce will be made accessible to majority of Indians.\r\n\r\nThis is how Pinduoduo democratized eCommerce for the less affluent in China.They are the fastest growing eCommerce company in the world, IPOing in a record three year time,They are already the second largest eCommerce player in China (launched only in 2015). We believe it’ll be bigger in India, because Indians are more price sensitive and socially connected (Just imagine the number of people in an Indian wedding)\r\n\r\nMost of our target customers will make their first online purchase at Mela. Join us and you'll help us shape the future of commerce in India.",

Scientists have been measuring gene activity in our cells for over twenty years now, but it’s remained a mystery how diseases are able to turn certain genes on or off. Breast cancer, for example, is driven by 198 genes being activated when they shouldn’t be, and we don’t know why.\r\n\r\nBut that’s about to change. Just a few years ago, biologists discovered new molecules that turn genes on and off. Collectively, these molecules are known as the “epigenome,” and they’re the control switches that determine how our cells work and give rise to disease. \r\n\r\nAt Arpeggio, we’ve developed a platform of biological and computational tools that make it possible to record changes in the epigenome over time and watch the results like a movie to see how drugs work. This gives scientists a clear understanding of how drugs and diseases function and has enabled our customers – including four of the top 10 pharmaceutical companies in the world – to match the right treatments to the right patients, screen new compounds, and reposition existing drugs into new indications. \r\n",

Our first product is a small molecule therapeutic for stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine, of which there are no FDA approved treatments.\r\n\r\nOur small molecule technology are atypical inhibitors of the dopamine transporter. Cocaine itself is an inhibitor of the same transporter. Directly reducing craving or positive reinforcement is a successful treatment strategy for addiction. Methadone or buprenorphine (Suboxone) are key examples of this for opioid use disorder. However, these types of medications can be addictive themselves. This has been a major hurdle for medication development for cocaine addiction and has led to many leaders in the addiction space to abandon the dopamine transporter as a target. At EncepHeal, we believe that the dopamine transporter should not be abandoned and instead focusing on fixing the abuse liability problem. Therefore with our partners at the National Institutes of Health, we have shown that these new, allosteric modulators at the dopamine transporter do not display addictive tendencies in animal models. They are also effective at curbing cocaine addiction. \r\n\r\nOur management team has two co-founders, Omeed Rahimi and Aaron Lazarus, as well as an experienced addiction pharmacologist as their research officer. The team has an advisory board with entrepreneurial and addiction drug development experience as well as expert partners at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a subset of the NIH, and Wake Forest.\r\n\r\nOur team has had success in raising non-dilutive funding and has expertise with SBIR/STTR grants. We are looking for help in better connecting with the biotech/pharmaceutical industry.\r\n\r\n",

We have tripled our revenue since the beginning of the year. \r\n\r\n**What do we do?** \r\n\r\nWe are building a complete digital health hub for future fathers. We aim to change the outdated view that fertility is a \"women's issue\" by creating an accessible, affordable product for men. This includes everything from a mail-in kit for sperm testing & sperm freezing, personalized sperm improvement products, tele-health, DNA fragmentation analysis, supplements, and more.\r\n\r\n**Why are we the leader?** \r\n\r\nThe company was founded at Harvard by a team of healthcare and fertility experts. Due to the high talent density at the company, we have built a strong, high-performing culture that has helped us crack channels beyond D2C like:\r\n\r\n1. Insurance (We are covered by United, Aetna, Cigna, TriWest, and others)\r\n2. Military (We serve the Navy SEALs through an exclusive program)\r\n3. Employers (We work with the top fertility benefit providers to service Snap, Salesforce, Slack, Princeton University, and other major employers)\r\n\r\n**Tell me about the team** \r\n\r\nWe're a team of about 30, extremely diverse (majority female, majority immigrants, strong LGBTIA+ representation, age range of 25-45), and very values driven.

Installing an actual CRM like Hubspot felt like a wrong fit for my informal relationships -- these people were 'my team,' not customers.\r\n\r\nDex is a lightweight personal CRM that’s easy to stick with. Key to Dex is a Chrome extension that enables you to manage relationships while you’re in Facebook, Messenger, Twitter, and the social apps you already use. Dex can also send you actionable reminders (daily, or based on your calendar events) to log your interactions for next time. By using Dex, you can:\r\n\r\n- Build stronger relationships, by sending you a nudge to follow-up.\r\n- Be more thoughtful, by helping you remember where you left off.\r\n- Become a superconnector, by making connections you wouldn’t otherwise remember.\r\n",

Opening of 100K new fuel stations is practically & economically impossible in urban localities due to rocketing high land prices. And that's how the idea of mobile refueling was conceptualized by founders. Literally \"bringing the gas stations to doorsteps\". The problem of buying fuel is much more alarming in large volume consumer segments such as Vehicle fleet users like schools, cab rentals, freight logistics operators , tours and travels operators, hospitals, hotels, real estate etc who burn huge amount of dead mileage & loss of productivity while sending all fleet vehicles to gas stations to fill up. Additionally, India has a unique problem of Electricity blackouts. Current avg. is less than 18 hours of a day of electricity in Indian metro cities, which causes more than 20 mln household and commercial buildings running on backup generators which require Diesel. They cant bring the generators to gas stations either therefore they buy Diesel in jerry cans or barrels and transport unsafely. Our solution is solving the desperate & daily need of Indian consumers along with convenience.\r\n\r\nDo we have domain expertise in this area? \r\nFounder is ex veteran of Shell with 9 years of global experience, has complete understanding Oil marketing business.\r\n\r\nHow do you know people need what you're making? \r\nWe have over 5000 registred large volume customers who are waiting to be served. With our limited number of refueling vehicles ,we could serve max 1200 customers currently. We got all these customers without spending a penny in marketing and promotion. Zero sales efforts. Additionally, we have received over 400 franchisee requests across India where people want to offer mobile refueling service their town validating the demand.",

We’ve won 39 patents and have an additional 51 under review.

We talked to these humans, and learned that they spend 1/3 of their time just asking other humans for documents and data that are almost universally available online. While the market is slowly moving to transactional data, Lendsnap is the only company helping lenders get ahead of the competition by delivering original electronic documents and data sets. That means portfolios of our lender customers stay completely liquid in the secondary market. No one else can offer that today.\r\n\r\nLendsnap instantly gathers the original borrower documents and data for lenders by linking to consumer financial accounts. We increase loan origination team productivity by 25%+ and save applicants several hours on each application as well. Our intuitive and easy-to-use workflow makes it easy and safe for borrowers to turn in and for loan officers to receive the necessary documents for lenders to make a credit decision.\r\n\r\nAs the only company delivering the right documents and data to originate non-agency loans such as VA, FHA, and subprime, we are able to work with all types of lenders. Furthermore, we are uniquely suited to serve mortgage brokers (12% market share) who have to remain flexible to the credit needs of their diverse borrowers.

The result of countless sleepless nights, numerous rolls of duct tape, a few everyday household objects, far too many takeouts and some epic battles with a kitten... it was released into an unsuspecting world at the entirely inappropriate time of 2am on New Year's Eve.\n\nSoon one app become four, and before we knew it we had lots of happy users and lots of great coverage by all sorts of people such The Telegraph, Wired, O'Reilly and MacFormat. Being a friendly bunch, we took the time to chat with the hundreds of you who said hello, and we found you all had the same problem: gyms were either too expensive, too daunting, too boring or too inconvenient. In other words, a lot of people needed another way to stay active.\n\nAnd the more people we spoke to, the bigger this problem seemed to be - it was like almost no one was active enough! Big problems require big solutions, so after raising some money from the visionaries at 4iP we amassed a team of the best designers, artists, 3d animators and programmers with the single mission: to improve the fu of the world by making an app so damn good that everyone will want to stay active.\n\nFitfu allows you to:\n\n* Track your motion\n\nUsing the accelerometer on your iPhone or iPod Touch, FitFu gives you feedback to help you keep going and reach your goals.\n\n* Celebrate progress with friends\n\nFriends are the key to sticking to your goals, so we've made FitFu social; whether you want to cheer them on, thank them for help or just compare your progress.\n\n* Discover a new way to stay motivated\n\nThe more you and your friends are active, the higher your level and the higher your points. And points mean prizes; unlock new content as you progress.\n\n* Stay active wherever, whenever\n\nNo more being tied to a games console or a gym, now you can stay active wherever you are - be that your bedroom, your office, a hotel room or in the cabin of your Mississippi boat. (Yes it happens!)\n\n*Lose what you want\n\nParticipate with Fitfu at your level of interest - decide to be gung ho, middle of the road, or simply casual.",

We developed our first prototype using cell culture media available on the market today. With this, the price of our chicken was $3000 US per lb. Would you buy a really good chicken nugget for $300? Probably not. \r\n\r\nWe prioritized overcoming this hurdle first, and we were successful! We developed an entirely new way of producing growth factors - which are the key (and most expensive) component of cell culture media. We realized this technology could solve the same problem all lab grown meat companies face. \r\n\r\nGiven our mission to singlehandedly kickstart the next agricultural revolution, we decided to pivot and focus on enabling the entire industry to succeed.

Not only that, but we also take care of all upcoming fixes, iterations, and updates without breaking any flow.\r\n\r\nIt's that easy, as it should be. Welcome to the future.",

Likewise, candidates won't have to start the vetting process over from scratch again and again since they'll be able to be referred with context and get warm intros into hot hiring companies that can be hard to access.

To get the freshest produce, you need quick producer-to-end-customer delivery, not just quick warehouse-to-customer delivery. Membo lets you order food directly from hundreds of local food producers & organises delivery so you always get the freshest version of every product. Membo's CEO, Vahur Hansen, was an early engineer at TransferWise, and co-founder, Paula Kink, built her own healthtech startup.

Pandai fills the demand with a solution that is better than the alternatives.\r\n\r\n👨‍🏫 Who We Are\r\n\r\nThe three founders are based in Malaysia and have known each other since high school, 23 years ago. \r\n\r\nAfter we graduated (from MIT & other US colleges), we started our first education company in 2007, focusing on coaching school students in STEM subjects.\r\n\r\nWe worked closely with students (many of them from underprivileged backgrounds) and saw firsthand the impact we’ve had on them. \r\n\r\nWe then realized that with technology, we could reach more students and bring more impact. Hence, we released Pandai in 2020. \r\n\r\n🚀 Present & Future\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have launched in our home ground Malaysia in 2020. \r\n\r\nSo far, 280,000 students have completed 83 million questions on Pandai, and 92% of users have seen some improvement in their academic performance. \r\n\r\nWe plan to expand to Southeast Asia and other emerging markets, a market of 100M+ school students. Pandai is designed to be scalable, and our content (also available in English) can be mapped to other curricula from other countries. ",

Popular filter artists today have 1m+ followers, their best filters get downloaded over 1B times each, and rarely (if ever!) do artists get paid for their work. So we fixed this with the best filter creation tools on the market and a marketplace that lets artists sell their work directly to their fans. We’ve recently launched our testflight and have already sold ~50 filters including one for $1200. We’re now scaling up to bigger artists (200k+ followers) and working towards a future where filters become digital fashion and are worn on social media, on stream, in VR, and on the streets with AR.",

Costs are split amongst the co-owners, and we take care of the furnishing and ongoing property management.\r\n\r\nWe accomplish this by creating an investment trust for each property and dividing it into individual, purchasable shares that represent ownership in the property. We furnish each home and find and vet the co-owners. Once all of the shares of the property are sold, we retain no ownership stake in the property and transition into the role of property manager, ensuring the home is well maintained and handling any issues that arise. Unlike a timeshare, Ancana owners own a real asset (the property) versus a block of time. If you decide you want to sell your share, you are free to do so at any time, either through us or on the open market, and capture any appreciation the property has accrued.",

We’re building a proactive computer vision tool for workplace safety - empowering industrial Health and Safety (HS) teams to identify risk and danger before it becomes a problem.\r\n\r\n🤕 The Problem:\r\nKeeping people safe at work is extremely hard. In the U.S. alone, there were over 5,000 deaths in the workplace in 2019, mainly in the heavy industry space.\r\n\r\nSerious workplace injuries cost U.S. businesses circa $62 Billion annually. Until now, safety has been reactive, someone has to get injured, and in some cases fatally before something is done about it.\r\n\r\n✅ Problem Solved:\r\nProtex AI’s platform uses privacy-preserving camera monitoring software to provide companies with an always-on guardian angel, protecting their workforce.\r\n\r\nThe platform plugs into existing CCTV infrastructure and enables HS teams to flexibly translate their document-based safety rules into the real world.\r\n\r\nProtex AI takes these rules and autonomously audits the customer’s facility to identify areas of high risk and non-compliance.\r\n\r\nHS teams can access this data via a reporting engine and use it in weekly safety meetings, external safety audits, insurance discussions, and legal claims.\r\n\r\nThe tool integrates seamlessly with existing safety workflows to augment data produced by any manual incident logging system in place.",

This ranges from missing a regular dentist check to missing an expensive MRI scan. With increasing pressure to improve access to care in developing countries, optimizing communication and coordination with patients is a key task to achieve. This is a massive problem especially in places where most people don't know how to effectively use self-service mediums (or are too busy to use them).\r\n \r\nWe bootstrapped the company and we are profitable. We currently have $97K in monthly revenue from 15 clients with a CMRG of 20% in the last year. We have 100% logo retention and we grow with our clients. We are currently coordinating over 600,000 medical appointments every month, just in Chile.\r\n\r\nThis problem represents a $3.5B market opportunity in Latin America only. Latin America has 650M people, each one having an average of 3 medical consultations per year. We charge for every time we effectively communicate with a patient. We plan to handle several coordination interactions with every patient for each consultation, which considers a roadmap of scheduling, confirming, booking, reimbursements, payments, among others.\r\n\r\nWe are a team mixing strong knowledge about the healthcare industry with deep technical skills. Felipe (CEO) is a former dentist that has led deep changes in healthcare payments in Chile. Mauricio (CTO) and Jorge (R&D), both PhD in Computer Science, led the creation of the most advanced Spanish Language Neural Network used daily by scientists and practitioners in LatAm (BETO: Spanish BERT).\r\n\r\nIn a weekend project, Mauricio and Jorge automated the communication with students attending a summer school obtaining impressive engagement. Felipe was struggling with contacting his patients to coordinate appointments, and saw a big opportunity in this technology. The three together have designed and run a solution that is currently coordinating over 600,000 patients per month in our home country, Chile.",

Some of the estimate suggests there could be a million underutilized kitchens in the US alone and a-lot more globally. Also we noticed most of the mom & pop stores lack branding and marketing skills which makes it difficult for them to compete against larger chains.\r\n\r\nMayaEats creates highly profitable and highly scalable delivery only brands based on data. Then, we partner with qualifying brick-n-motor / cloud restaurants who have under utilized kitchens nationwide who fulfill orders which are delivered via third-party delivery services including Doordash, UberEats, Grubhub and many others. MayaEats provides menus & recipes with full training and handles all promotions. Restaurant owners have to do only one thing well, prepare delicious food for the customers.\r\n\r\nSo far launched 60+ digital stores, processed around 53,000 orders, made around $1.85 Million in GMV and $375,000 in revenue.\r\n\r\nMayaEats' bigger vision is to launch over 500,000 digital restaurants in the next few years.",

This results in uncollected sales, lost inventory, and wasted time.\r\n\r\nWe can help them digitize bookkeeping because we are engineers with experience building for a billion+ users across TikTok, Amazon, and Quora.

Zeit’s smart headband immediately detects the onset of stroke and notifies 911. Each year more than 90% of the one million strokes in the US go untreated, resulting in life-long disability and exploding medical costs north of $100b. The lack of timely treatment is the result of delays in alerting the emergency services. More than 10 million Americans with an elevated stroke risk live with constant fear that a stroke may go unnoticed for hours, while they are asleep or alone. The company was founded by Orestis Vardoulis  PhD  a biomedical & mechanical engineer and expert in digital health (EPFL/Stanford) and Urs Naber  MD  a critical care physician (Dartmouth/Stanford). They have both seen the devastating effects of stroke in their families and came up with the idea of addressing this unmet clinical need during their Stanford Biodesign Innovation Fellowship.",

Our work has already been used to modify cancer specific antibodies, but the most exciting application is in the emerging field of immune tolerance induction. Catena’s technology allows us to couple receptor binding proteins to immune triggering partners, letting us retrain the immune system when it targets healthy proteins. Such treatments could effectively cure autoimmune diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis, Graves' Disease and Hashimoto's by limiting inflammation towards ankyrin, anoctamin, and other self-antigens.\r\n",

This eliminates Lizards and Sales Agents, saving the other 25%.\r\nWe do not use the standard industry models, instead using a multiperil model to more granularly price risk.

That’s where Oncobox comes in. Oncobox is low-cost personalized genetic profiling to help doctors decide which drug to use. In a recent study conducted by leading cancer researchers in Europe and Asia on 900 patients with a variety of late-stage cancers, Oncobox increased the effectiveness of targeted therapies from 25% to 64%.\n\nHow does Oncobox work? Over 150 targeted cancer drugs are currently on the market. But deciding which of these drugs to give to late-stage cancer patients is not a simple task. Cancer doctors are in a race against the clock, they don’t always know which drug will be most effective for their patients, and because these drugs are expensive and typically have significant side effects, they can’t just try them all. Because of these barriers, targeted cancer therapies are effective only 25% of the time, and 70% of patients with late-stage cancers die due to the toxic side effects of ineffective drugs.\n\nAt an estimated cost of $2,000 per patient, the Oncobox Integral Test analyzes DNA and RNA of over 2000 genes that are included in major molecular pathways using algorithms to distinguish which molecular targets are the most crucial for individual cases and finds the right drug for them. Doctors receive a clinically actionable report that shows them which drugs are likely to be most effective on the patient.\n\nWe are actively seeking partners from pharma, hospitals/clinicians, payers, and genomic centers. If you are in Oncobox for your patients, contact us at hello@oncobox.com. \n\nOur team and scientific advisory board consists of leading scientists and researchers from Moscow State University, Stanford, Johns Hopkins University, Boston University, Tufts University, and Rutgers University.",

This allows to provide uninterruptible power, or go off-grid.\r\n\r\nAirthium plans to sell its combined storage/generation units to industrial/commercial buildings in developing countries, in areas where electricity is expensive or unstable, as a drop-in replacement of their diesel engines that could also store energy efficiently.\r\n\r\nPlease see Airthium's website for more information.",

Most of this treatment is funded by governments, and goes to programs that are frequently predatory, and focus more on profit than people.\r\n\r\nWe have created an effective, accessible, and affordable solution: Recover. We offer a proven approach using medication and counseling, that can improve outcomes for over 70% of patients. It reduces overdoses by 80%, death by 50%, and has years of research and application showing it works. \r\n\r\nDespite how effective this medication can be, most rehabs do not have medical professionals on staff. Not only does our program work better and bring medicine to addiction care, it also costs just 10% of traditional programs.\r\n\r\nNick founded Recover after seeing his family and friends struggle with addiction. He was raised by a drug addict, has an alcoholic brother, and lost an uncle to heroin. He saw how hard it is for people to get the treatment they need, and how ineffective existing options are.

By operating within a wingspan of the water, seagliders have double the range of electric aircraft thanks to aerodynamic and operational efficiencies.  \r\n\r\nUnlike conventional aircraft configurations, our first seaglider will be capable of 180 miles at 180 mph with existing battery technology. Beginning in 2025, our seagliders will commence real world operations, build consumer trust, and generate revenue while our aircraft-building competitors are still embroiled in regulatory and technical challenges. In the future, when those challenges have been overcome, REGENT will transition seagliders to the air and grow upon years of commercial success.\r\n\r\nIn the last 3 months we have closed $250M in LOIs from airlines and ferry companies. They have been so eager to switch to REGENT because our vehicle is half as expensive as an airplane and six times faster than ferries.\r\n",

By implementing Vue Storefront, you will improve your overall User Experience and lift up your revenues but at least 20%. \r\n\r\n1. Lightning Fast\r\nWe are on the mission to improve loading times for eCommerce users, especially on mobile devices. We want to make sure, that every site using Vue Storefront will load in under 2 seconds for all users across the globe. Currently, it is their weak spot:  \r\na) It takes, on average, 15.3 seconds to fully load a mobile page. \r\nb) 75% of mobile sites take longer than 10 seconds to load.  \r\nc) 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load. \r\n\r\nLoading times mean better User Experience and this leads to eCommerce users buying more, giving better conversion rates:  \r\na) Walmart found that for every 1 second improvement in page load time, conversions increased by 2%  \r\nb) Increase of conversion % at each stage of Customer Buying Journey at eCommerce based on 0.1s improvement based on Google Research (https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/future-of marketing/creativity/mobile-page-speed-data/) \r\n\r\n2. Fast Time To Value\r\nVue Storefront is the glue for headless commerce,  giving merchants the ability to connect with any eCommerce backend, any CMS or any other 3rd party service, as we provide those API’s by default in our cloud platform.  This is saving our clients thousands of development hours. \r\n\r\nAlso, because of the Progressive Web App features that we provide, there is no need to build native iOS or Android apps - everything is available through the web. In combination with frontend components provided out of the box, it is possible to build a new eCommerce frontend within weeks, not months. \r\n\r\n3. Fast content adjustments  with any Headless CMS\r\nHeadless CMS is the only way to embrace omnichannel sales, and we know it. That is why the Enterprise version of Vue Storefront delivers the API-first setup of integrations with the best Headless CMSes out-of-the-box. \r\n\r\nIt allows business users to edit the content & publish with no-code approach\r\n\r\n4. Fast learning curve for developers  \r\nWe use the modern tech stack that is easily adaptable by the developer community, and what is better market proof than the popularity of our Open Source Project? We are currently 5th most popular eCommerce framework globally and the 1st Frontend eCommerce Framework globally!\r\nhttps://docs.vuestorefront.io/v2/\r\nhttps://www.vuestorefront.io/",

Every class, students need to turn in assignments that are corrected by their mentors and at the end of the course they need to turn in and approve a final project. We also help our selected students with careers services such as mockup interviews, Linkedin enhancement, and more. All of this creates a level of accountability that allows us to achieve really low churn levels (<9%).\r\n\r\nOur career tracks last between 9-11 months and we give our selected students their money back in case they don't get a job 6 months after they are done with the course.",

The founders Patricia Bubner, PhD, Samet Yildirim, MSc, MBS and Gabriel Levesque-Tremblay, PhD have over 30 years of combined experience in business and product development, bioprocessing and biopharma. After only 4 months of development time, Orbillion has four different flavorful meats growing in the lab: wagyu beef, elk, sheep and American bison. Using their proprietary platform technology, Orbillion is rapidly decreasing the cost of cultivated meat. Major investors in our pre seed round were Y Combinator, New Protein Fund, Joyance Partners and Venture Souq. https://www.orbillion.com/",

I was able to use the resources KickUp created for a board report and now the district is interested in seeing how all of the other departments can benefit from their services. We are in need of someone who can take that step back and see the big picture of what we are trying to accomplish with professional development, effective student learning, and assessment and tie it all together for us in ways that make sense.

Educators now recognize that data can inform decisions that improve student outcomes, but few are equipped to make sense of data in a timely manner. Efforts to be “data-driven” require costly software, time-consuming setup, and extensive training. The resulting reports, which are often complex and outdated, fail to provide the information needed for daily decision-making.\n\nWHAT IS LEARNSPROUT?\n\nLearnSprout is an online data insights service for K-12 educators. It is the only education analytics solution available that uses live data directly from a district’s student information system. LearnSprout combines assessment results, course grades, and attendance to provide actionable insights into student and school performance.

We create beautifully designed software with a simple and intuitive user experience to help you get the most out of your HSA. \r\n\r\nGo to www.livelyme.com to learn about how HSAs can help you and your team.",

Their first product is the Prosthetic Interface Device (PID), a universal connector integrated directly into the arm and connected to the nervous system - a \"USB connector\" for bionic arms. By using machine learning and AI to understand nerve signals, they are aiming to make bionic arms an extension of a person's body that can be controlled naturally with the mind, and will allow for sensation to be fed back into the body. CBAS currently has the largest neural data set in the world, performing cutting edge machine learning research and they are also exploring implementing this technology to other conditions throughout the body, revolutionising chronic healthcare from delivery to recurrent care.",

We invest in the most liquid segment of the art market, with the lowest volatility, yielding tremendous growth uncorrelated to traditional investments. Arthena’s automated and data driven investment strategy regulates art investment by building traditional fund structures. HNWI’s can now securely and confidently diversify their portfolios into alternative assets focusing on the luxury market.\r\n\r\nArthena has designed and built a statistically rigorous model that estimates the value of artwork over time. Since the data we obtain derives from auction records and repeat sales, our model relies on a set of features about each result. These features include include the artist’s name, medium, date of creation, origin of location and size of work. After identifying groups of work that are similar to each other, we calculate the expected ROI and estimated volatility based on the distribution of gains. Using historical auction results to simulate the performance of our funds, we leverage Monte Carlo analysis to determine annualized returns and sharpe ratios. Based on this analysis, Arthena can validate the financial viability of our product and establish statistically rigorous bounds for these estimates.",

    "long_description": "We’re on a mission to optimize the agricultural industry.\r\n\r\nWhen we started Bountiful in 2015, the grape error rate for predicting production was 30 percent. Why? We found that many farmers in the specialty crops space were still using traditional pencil-and-paper techniques to predict yield. These low-fidelity forecasting methods weren’t giving them a clear enough understanding of their production until it was too late, leading to waste and inefficiency throughout the supply chain.\r\n\r\nWe saw a problem we wanted to solve.\r\n\r\nToday, Bountiful is using advanced data science to help farmers forecast more accurately, so they can make better decisions. In the last three years, we’ve combined the latest in machine learning with weather, satellite, geographic, and historical data. The result is a user-friendly platform that transforms volumes of complex agricultural information into simple, actionable insights farmers can use to run more economically and environmentally sustainable farms.\r\n\r\nMore recently, we’re working to open the dialogue between buyers and sellers, remove uncertainty, and provide clarity to the supply chain to meet global food demand.\r\n\r\nOur ultimate goal is to close the agricultural margin of error. Not only will this make individual farms more efficient, profitable, and sustainable, but it will help optimize the global food supply chain. That means healthier people and a healthier planet.",

As video streaming continues to become more mainstream and the streams themselves become HD and 4K, traditional CDNs struggle to deliver high quality viewing experiences.

Not only is this expensive, but it's also inefficient, which is why at Peer5, we've created a P2P CDN to boost your video streaming capabilities. \r\n\r\nOur CDN works with your servers to ensure that as your viewership increases, your network gets stronger by offloading bandwidth to our peer network. On average, this has been shown to increase server capacity by 20x, offload 70% of bandwidth, increase viewing time by 30% and decrease instances of rebuffering by 40%.\r\n\r\nOur video streaming CDN uses emerging technologies, including HTML5 and WebRTC. They require no installation by end users and offer easy integration for content providers. We support many different streaming protocols, players and media servers.",

This is where imgix has your back. imgix is a platform for managing, processing, rendering, optimizing, and delivering your existing images so that you can meet the demands of your business and your team can stay focused on what they do best.\r\n\r\nThe business demands on web images can blindside even the most hyper-aware content teams and developers. Just to be competitive on the Internet, you need your images to be sized perfectly to every device, served in one of any of a half dozen web formats, optimized to the absolute best perceptual quality while maintaining pinpoint performance, and distributed to wherever your users are, anywhere in the world. And that is just the baseline. Next-level imaging concerns like copyright, licensing, accessibility, moderation, illegal or explicit content, \"fake news\", and more, can threaten your business at any moment if not handled properly. Get any of these things wrong and you are shedding revenue, ceding ground to competitors, and potentially exposing your business to extreme liability.\r\n\r\nBy working with imgix's powerful APIs, SDKs, user interfaces, and integrations, you can rest assured that any demands on your images will always be met, now and into the future, without you having to invest in building it yourself or patching together a mishmash of open source and third-party technologies. Our platform is designed to ensure that your images are always working for your business and never against it.\r\n\r\nimgix is venture-backed, with about $11 million in investment, and was launched through the famed Y Combinator accelerator program.

Yet, ask that same child to write out a story in a blank notebook or a word processor and you would be lucky to capture a fraction of the depth and splendor of his or her imagination. Play inspires and scaffolds the creative process from an early age, but there is a persistent gap between the origins of imaginative play (ages 4-5) and kids' adoption of the formal discipline of creative writing (ages 8-10).\n\nAt Launchpad Toys, we're using mobile devices like the iPad to bridge this gap between informal and formal learning, to harness the power of play to help children capture and share their ideas with other kids around the world. Our first product, Toontastic an app for the iPad, is a creative learning tool that blends constructionist and social development theories to empower young children to create, learn, and share their ideas through play.",

This approach has been proven to fully reverse obesity and type 2 diabetes in animals. However, therapeutic application for humans was impossible, because mitochondrial heat production could only be induced by highly artificial methods with side effects. This changed after our recent breakthrough discovery of the protein that mitochondria naturally use to generate heat. We have developed a unique high-throughput drug discovery platform to identify compounds that selectively activate this target protein, without side effects.\r\n\r\nFor decades people have wanted a drug that burns calories like exercise does.

Our online program is 3X more effective at 1/4th the cost.\r\n\r\nThe user receives bi-weekly 1-1 coaching focused on behavioral changes, online community for support and motivation, and a mobile app that provides educational lessons, lifestyle tracking tools and weekly challenges (gamification). The content and behavioral change techniques are centred around healthy diet, fitness, lifestyle and stress reduction.\r\n\r\nOur unique coaching methodology employs cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), goal-oriented treatment and self-efficacy enhancement. The coach helps the user bust negative emotions of past failures in weight-loss and increase motivation by linking short-term achievable goals with the user's personal values. Through the program, the user is able to self-identify triggers of unhealthy habit adoption and make better decisions.\r\n\r\nBreathe Well-being has demonstrated success in helping people lose weight, build long-term healthy habits and reduce/eliminate medication for lifestyle diseases (example - Type 2 Diabetes). We are looking for ideas to improve our sales processes so that we can get users to enrol at a higher conversion rate post our 1-week free trial. We need to identify triggers when users are most likely to pay and provide them with a seamless process for paying on-the-spot.",

The pandemic spurred interest among new investors, and our AUM has grown 3x since April 2020. And we’ve done this with a cost of acquisition that is 10% of the industry average. \r\n\r\nHere’s the problem we see. Only 10% of the 100 million middle-income Indian workers have invested in the markets. This is despite the fact that they save ~30% of their income, making this a $325B potential market in assets under management. \r\n\r\nHowever, current investment apps in India are built for active investors. With over 16,000+ mutual funds and 5000+ stocks to choose from, they are far too complicated for beginners, who make up most of the market.\r\n\r\nWe’re building an AI - driven investment planning software that is designed for beginners. Users use our conversational AI to get diversified mutual fund portfolios tailored to their goals. We also offer users a credit card secured by their investments, so they can earn return without losing liquidity.\r\n\r\nIn terms of business model, we make commissions on the asset we manage, and interchange fees on the fund. We estimate we can make $12 per user per year, which is 6x our current acquisition cost of $2 per investor.",

With Spenny, they just connect the card and invest every time they spend.\r\n\r\nWe're growing 67% WoW since launch, with 3,000+ users and $15,000 in AUM. Indians put $500Bn into their bank accounts annually. We charge 1.75% of the AUM for investments. That's a direct ~$9Bn market in India alone.\r\n\r\nPotentially every time a user makes a transaction, we make money. And in that sense, the timing for Spenny couldn't have been better: 1 Trillion+ transactions are expected in 2021 because of factors like Whatsapp launching its P2P payments in India for its 400M users. And the emergence of UPI means every Indian has a virtual bank account now. \r\n\r\nMore interesting revenue models develop from the transaction data insights of our users. We analyse the rich data to A) up-sell more financial products like insurance etc., and B) create brand loyalty programs & partnerships.\r\n\r\nWe acquire customers at minimal CAC by bank partnerships. We leverage the banks' existing users, by integrating with their mobile app. In turn, we invest into their mutual funds.\r\n\r\nOur long-term vision is to become a one-stop asset management solution for millennials.",

However, many youngsters, especially women are not comfortable joining dating platforms because of privacy concerns, stalkers and societal judgement. \r\n\r\nHumBee is an avatar based social app where you can match and chat with interesting people near you without revealing your real identity. If you hit it off, you have the option of revealing yourself. HumBee is a place where you can chat with interesting people based on your personality, Youtube activity, interests and passions. We are building a new age social network for the Indian social context. Our unique concept provides a social platform that is private, safe and fun.\r\n\r\nWe launched in September and have already acquired over 20k users organically. We have a rating of 5 on the Play Store. We are going after 300m+ young Indians who are online with potential for further expansion in similar societies like the Middle East and South East Asia.\r\n\r\nOur vision is to build a pseudonymous social network where people can meet, vibe and find a deep connection with one another. A network that is private, safe and fun for everyone. \r\n\r\nYou can checkout HumBee on the Play Store at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.humbeeapp",

Our first product is an API that healthcare startups use to submit insurance claims - kind of like Stripe for medical billing.\r\n\r\nHealthcare providers in the US spend $280B a year -- 8% of their revenue -- on medical billing. It’s one of the largest inefficiencies in the American healthcare system. The incumbents in this fragmented space are service companies that throw armies of humans at the problem. Humans may be good at tackling the outrageous complexities of medical billing, but are expensive, slow, and error-prone. We’re charging less and getting providers paid more by using data science, modern workflow automation, and machine learning to rethink medical billing from the ground up.\r\n\r\nToday, we charge 5% of the payments we process in exchange for handling everything relating to getting paid: translating doctor’s notes into billable codes, claim submission, appealing denied claims, collecting from patients, and providing sophisticated monitoring & analysis for all of it. This positions us extraordinarily well for our long-term vision of being a complete financial hub for healthcare providers: not only handling billing, but also using billing data to better underwrite loans and AR factoring.",

We demonstrate a reduction in fibrosis with our drug, but more significantly, we show a reversal in fibrotic tissue back to normal tissue. \r\n\r\nWith our current developmental strategy, we hope to have a clinic-ready compound by the end of 2021 and be in phase I clinical trials by mid of 2022. \r\n",

We offer online doctor’s visits, withdrawal medication prescriptions, and support for long-term recovery, using a protocol 6x more effective than most rehabs (2/3rds of which don't have doctors).\r\n\r\nMore than 3 million Americans are addicted to opioids, but 80% are not getting help, due to jobs, families, and privacy concerns. Meanwhile, there's a proven treatment that increases survival rates by 600%, and it's low cost, discreet, and convenient. It's called MAT, and it looks like treatment for anxiety or depression: medication plus therapy. However, doctors need a special waiver to prescribe the medication, which fewer than 5% of them have, so it's difficult to get, and most people are buying it on the street. Sadly, drug dealers aren't doctors: every 11 minutes another American dies of an opioid overdose, now the #1 cause of death for Americans under 50.\r\n\r\nOphelia is replacing rehab with telemedicine, using proven science and a consumer-first approach. The opioid treatment market in the U.S. is $15B, and 85% of opioid addicts have insurance that pays for it. We're treating roughly 400 patients with thousands more waiting.\r\n\r\nZack started Ophelia after losing his girlfriend to an opioid overdose, who found it easier to get medication from a drug dealer than a doctor.

Maintaining a cap table is more than just recording the number of shares. Ownership across the company constantly changes as employees join and leave, and fundraising rounds are raised. Pulley is a platform to track all these equity related changes and keep company records up-to-date.\r\n\r\nPulley helps founders answer important questions such as:\r\n\r\n1. How much dilution will take between different fundraising options? \r\n2. What is the difference between a post and pre-money SAFE?\r\n3. How will pro rata rights impact my ownership in future rounds much of the company will I own by the A?\r\n\r\nWith Pulley, founders can model dilution across fundraising rounds to better understand their ownership as the company scales.

The current tire changing industry is entrenched with an aging workforce but maintains strong margins. We will build and deploy a robotic tire changing container that can change tires in 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nOur fully-integrated ROBOTIRE containers can be placed inside existing shops, Walmart parking lots or in the middle of a fleet service area hundreds of miles away from a major city. In the medium term, we will expand to brakes, oil, batteries, etc. becoming an uptime assembly line that keeps fleets on the road 24/7 at a fraction of the maintenance cost per mile we see today.

Founded in 2018 by Bagrat Grigoryan and Jordan Miller as a spin-out from Rice University, the full potential of our work is to build whole human organ replacements for patients, made from their own cells.\r\n\r\nOur Technology and Approach\r\nWe have invented a suite of breakthrough 3D bioprinting technologies, featured on the cover of Science, that can build human tissue with complex blood vessel networks. We are leveraging this technology in the short term to build patient-specific tissues for drug safety and efficacy testing. Patient cells are taken from a biopsy, added to our proprietary 3D printed tissues, and then drug compounds are injected through the blood vessel network to mimic actual drug delivery in humans. Our vision is that our technology will provide rigorous, reproducible, and predictive outcomes for patients, resulting in drastically improved outcomes for diseases like cancer. More broadly, we see the full potential of our mission as being able to produce functional tissue and organ replacements for diseased or damaged vital organs in the body such as the lung, liver, pancreas, kidney, and heart.\r\n",

This approach is novel because we are no longer looking at average signals and can be precise. It is like a police person trying to identify the speeding car, they won’t find it if they look at all the cars at once, rather they need to look at the speed of each individual car. This is the beauty of single cell genomics, we can now identify that speeding car.\r\n\r\nWhy now?\r\nThe biggest barrier for entry into the single cell genomics market are cost and data analysis. To that end, we have reduced the cost by 10-fold and built the computational infrastructure for scalability. Although single cell sequencing has only been around for about five years, we come from one of the top single cell genomics labs and were the first to process and analyze millions of immune cells. Thanks to our software solutions, we have been able to bring big data solutions to the immune system.\r\n\r\nWhere are we and where are we going?\r\nWe have generated a database of over 1 million immune cells spanning healthy, cancerous, and autoimmune immune cells and are growing through paid partnerships. Harnessing out database and ML software, we can take a data-centric approach for better target discovery. Fortunately, as our database continues to grow, our models will continue to learn for more precise, unbiased, and automated single cell genomics.\r\n\r\nThank you! ",
