When users search for a topic on Scoopler, they get the most relevant results, updated in real-time.

Scoopler has now become JustSpotted, a celebrity-tracking tool, meant to give fans an idea of what their favorite celebrities are up to at any given moment. JustSpotted, like Scoopler, is a data-aggregator, yet JustSpotted collects from Twitter, Facebook, and Foursquare -- alongside their own data theyâ€™ll be collecting from users who actual spot celebrities in the wild. All the information we aggregate is publicly available and you can even do a search on Twitter yourself and find sightings of celebrities. We're just the first people to organize it on a map and in such a way that it's easy to consume and ENJOY.â€

JustSpotted is about connecting with celebs. All the sightings on our website are naturally occurring events where an everyday person bumps into a celebrity as a chance occurrence. Back in the day, when you saw a celebrity while you were out and about the first thing you would have done was phone or text a friend.

When we started Bountiful in 2015, the grape error rate for predicting production was 30 percent. Why? We found that many farmers in the specialty crops space were still using traditional pencil-and-paper techniques to predict yield. These low-fidelity forecasting methods weren’t giving them a clear enough understanding of their production until it was too late, leading to waste and inefficiency throughout the supply chain.

We saw a problem we wanted to solve.

Today, Bountiful is using advanced data science to help farmers forecast more accurately, so they can make better decisions. In the last three years, we’ve combined the latest in machine learning with weather, satellite, geographic, and historical data. The result is a user-friendly platform that transforms volumes of complex agricultural information into simple, actionable insights farmers can use to run more economically and environmentally sustainable farms.

More recently, we’re working to open the dialogue between buyers and sellers, remove uncertainty, and provide clarity to the supply chain to meet global food demand.

THE PROBLEM:

K-12 districts collect an enormous amount of student data. Educators now recognize that data can inform decisions that improve student outcomes, but few are equipped to make sense of data in a timely manner. Efforts to be “data-driven” require costly software, time-consuming setup, and extensive training. The resulting reports, which are often complex and outdated, fail to provide the information needed for daily decision-making.

Yuma is using LLMs to automate customer support. We integrate directly with help desk software and focus on helping large Shopify merchants deal with their high volume of support requests.
 
## Why do Shopify merchants need Yuma?

There are thousands of Shopify merchants around the world generating $10M+ a year. Most of them have taken over some niches and are great at what they do: selling their products.

But they all have one thing in common: they all hate customer support. It's a burden for them and a huge source of cost, as they receive hundreds of requests per day. Some of them have dozens of support agents on staff, usually offshore, and the overall quality is still often pretty poor while staff turnover remains high.

Those merchants have been promised automation for years but have always been disappointed by the outcome. As customers, we have all had to live through a terrible support automation experience before, so this is no secret, and everyone knows that the current state of the technology is quite bad.

## Yuma is solving this in a few ways:

First and most importantly, we believe that the recent advances in AI technology finally make solving this problem achievable.

By coupling LLMs with custom-built knowledge bases, Yuma is able to suggest drafts that are relevant and customized to the support agents. With a one-click install, Yuma can natively integrate with any help desk software without disrupting current workflows, but only augmenting them.

By using LLMs to analyze historical tickets, Yuma can mimic the writing style of a brand, but also learn and replicate current workflows without any configuration needed, bringing the setup and adoption cost to almost zero.

Yuma also offers the ability to build a new kind of smart and dynamic workflows that were not possible before, with a plain English description of a given scenario.

Finally, LLMs also make working with multiple languages a breeze. The agents can focus their work on a single language, knowing that their output will always be appropriate and grammatically correct.

## Fun Fact

Yuma got started by accident. This is my third YC startup after Socialcam (W12) and Triplebyte (S15).

By teaching our body’s immune system to recognize and kill the drivers of cancer, we can eliminate the majority of all cancer deaths.

A little more detail to understand our scientific approach: A normal cell turns into cancer when it develops a mutation that makes it grow aggressively. Surprisingly, a small number of these mutations account for the vast majority of cancer deaths. The immune system usually doesn’t recognize these mutations, but our technology platform enables us to train the immune system to recognize and attack these cancers. Our first product is a vaccine for the treatment of lung cancer that targets the KRAS mutation, the most common mutation in cancer, accounting for about 30% of all cancer deaths. In the long run, we envision a world where every adult receives our vaccines annually – preventing the majority of cancer deaths. 

Our team includes some of the leading cancer vaccine experts in the world including: our Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Liz Jaffee (Chair of President Biden’s Cancer Advisory Panel) and our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Mark Yarchoan (principal investigator of multiple cancer vaccine clinical trials). Our team is led by our Chief Executive Officer, Jen Herbach, who has more than a decade of biotech industry experience including with Amunix (the second largest oncology pre-clinical stage acquisition).

In East Asia, the webcomic (or digital manga) industry is an $12B market and rapidly growing to the rest of the world. Webtoon, the largest company in the space, generates $100M / month in revenue. However, their addressable market is limited by their content creators, who need know how to draw. Readers are desperate for a greater variety of stories in webcomics.


Through years of working with filmmakers, we’ve built extremely easy to use storyboarding software  that has 700K users. We’re democratizing visual storytelling to everyone. We’re working on the next generation that, through advances in video game interfaces, ubiquitous 3D compute, and AI, will allow anyone to easily create scenes, pose characters, to create webcomics.

This is where imgix has your back. imgix is a platform for managing, processing, rendering, optimizing, and delivering your existing visual assets so that you can meet the demands of your business and your team can stay focused on what they do best.

The business demands on web visual media can blindside even the most hyper-aware content teams and developers. Just to be competitive on the Internet, you need your images to be sized perfectly to every device, served in one of any of a half dozen web formats, optimized to the absolute best perceptual quality while maintaining pinpoint performance, and distributed to wherever your users are, anywhere in the world. And that is just the baseline. Next-level imaging concerns like copyright, licensing, accessibility, moderation, illegal or explicit content, ""fake news"", and more, can threaten your business at any moment if not handled properly. Get any of these things wrong and you are shedding revenue, ceding ground to competitors, and potentially exposing your business to extreme liability.

By working with imgix's powerful APIs, SDKs, user interfaces, and integrations, you can rest assured that any demands on your images and videos will always be met, now and into the future, without you having to invest in building it yourself or patching together a mishmash of open source and third-party technologies.

Give a young child a couple of toys or a box of crayons and he or she is likely to play for hours, deeply engrossed in an imaginary world. In both art and dramatic play, children construct settings, create fictional characters, and act out fantastic storylines that would be the envy of many Hollywood scriptwriters. Yet, ask that same child to write out a story in a blank notebook or a word processor and you would be lucky to capture a fraction of the depth and splendor of his or her imagination. Play inspires and scaffolds the creative process from an early age, but there is a persistent gap between the origins of imaginative play (ages 4-5) and kids' adoption of the formal discipline of creative writing (ages 8-10).

At Launchpad Toys, we're using mobile devices like the iPad to bridge this gap between informal and formal learning, to harness the power of play to help children capture and share their ideas with other kids around the world. Our first product, Toontastic an app for the iPad, is a creative learning tool that blends constructionist and social development theories to empower young children to create, learn, and share their ideas through play.","Creativity at Play.

Legacy (YC S19) is a Series B startup focused on the fast-growing field of fertility and family planning. Founded at Harvard, the company has now raised almost $50M from leading investors like FirstMark Capital, Bain Capital Ventures, Section 32, Tribe Capital, and even celebrities like Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, and others. For context, we've closed 4 venture rounds in 2.5 years, in addition to our celebrity round of funding. 

**What we're doing**

We are building a complete digital health hub for future fathers/parents. We aim to change the outdated view that fertility is a ""women's issue"" by creating an accessible, affordable product for men & people with sperm. This includes everything from a mail-in kit for sperm testing & sperm freezing, personalized sperm improvement products, tele-health, DNA fragmentation analysis, supplements, and more.

**Why are we the leader?** 

The company was founded at Harvard by a team of healthcare and fertility experts. We obsess about talent density and have out-executed our competitors over the past few years. Beyond our D2C channel, we've also unlocked:

1. Insurance (We cover over 10M individuals through insurance in NY and CA)
2. Military (We serve the Navy SEALs & other SpecOps through exclusive programs)
3. Employers (We work with the top fertility benefit providers like Progyny, Carrot, and Maven)

**Tell me about the team** 

We're a team of under 50, extremely diverse (majority female, majority immigrants, strong LGBQTIA+ representation, age range of 25-65), and very values driven. Our 5 values are customer centricity, reliability, kindness, openness, and winning.

Dex helps turn your acquaintances into your allies.  Going beyond the superficiality of social networks requires commitment.  If you remember to keep in touch thoughtfully, you can turn the interesting person you met at a networking event into a friend that has your back.  

I built Dex after failing to keep up with the tools I tried (Airtable, Notion, etc) for relationship management. Installing an actual CRM like Hubspot felt like a wrong fit for my informal relationships -- these people were 'my team,' not customers.

Dex is a lightweight personal CRM that’s easy to stick with. Key to Dex is a Chrome extension that enables you to manage relationships while you’re in Facebook, Messenger, Twitter, and the social apps you already use. Dex can also send you actionable reminders (daily, or based on your calendar events) to log your interactions for next time. By using Dex, you can:

- Build stronger relationships, by sending you a nudge to follow-up.

India is a country with 200 mln vehicles (about the same number as USA) but one third the number of gas stations(60K) as compare to USA(160K), The consequence of odd number of fuel stations is long queues of vehicles at the gas stations to fill up, heavily congested Indian roads make it worse. Opening of 100K new fuel stations is practically & economically impossible in urban localities due to rocketing high land prices. And that's how the idea of mobile refueling was conceptualized by founders. Literally ""bringing the gas stations to doorsteps"". The problem of buying fuel is much more alarming in large volume consumer segments such as Vehicle fleet users like schools, cab rentals, freight logistics operators , tours and travels operators, hospitals, hotels, real estate etc who burn huge amount of dead mileage & loss of productivity while sending all fleet vehicles to gas stations to fill up. Additionally, India has a unique problem of Electricity blackouts. Current avg. is less than 18 hours of a day of electricity in Indian metro cities, which causes more than 20 mln household and commercial buildings running on backup generators which require Diesel. They cant bring the generators to gas stations either therefore they buy Diesel in jerry cans or barrels and transport unsafely. Our solution is solving the desperate & daily need of Indian consumers along with convenience.

Do we have domain expertise in this area? 
Founder is ex veteran of Shell with 9 years of global experience, has complete understanding Oil marketing business.

How do you know people need what you're making? 
We have over 5000 registred large volume customers who are waiting to be served. With our limited number of refueling vehicles ,we could serve max 1200 customers currently. We got all these customers without spending a penny in marketing and promotion. Zero sales efforts.

Our first product is a small molecule therapeutic for stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine, of which there are no FDA approved treatments.

Our small molecule technology are atypical inhibitors of the dopamine transporter. Cocaine itself is an inhibitor of the same transporter. Directly reducing craving or positive reinforcement is a successful treatment strategy for addiction. Methadone or buprenorphine (Suboxone) are key examples of this for opioid use disorder. However, these types of medications can be addictive themselves. This has been a major hurdle for medication development for cocaine addiction and has led to many leaders in the addiction space to abandon the dopamine transporter as a target. At EncepHeal, we believe that the dopamine transporter should not be abandoned and instead focusing on fixing the abuse liability problem. Therefore with our partners at the National Institutes of Health, we have shown that these new, allosteric modulators at the dopamine transporter do not display addictive tendencies in animal models. They are also effective at curbing cocaine addiction. 

Our management team has two co-founders, Omeed Rahimi and Aaron Lazarus, as well as an experienced addiction pharmacologist as their research officer. The team has an advisory board with entrepreneurial and addiction drug development experience as well as expert partners at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a subset of the NIH, and Wake Forest.

Our team has had success in raising non-dilutive funding and has expertise with SBIR/STTR grants. We are looking for help in better connecting with the biotech/pharmaceutical industry.

Lenders will write $1.5T of home mortgages in 2017, and will have to evaluate every single borrower's ability to repay. This is expected to cost the industry $15B in human labor. We talked to these humans, and learned that they spend 1/3 of their time just asking other humans for documents and data that are almost universally available online. While the market is slowly moving to transactional data, Lendsnap is the only company helping lenders get ahead of the competition by delivering original electronic documents and data sets. That means portfolios of our lender customers stay completely liquid in the secondary market. No one else can offer that today.

Lendsnap instantly gathers the original borrower documents and data for lenders by linking to consumer financial accounts. We increase loan origination team productivity by 25%+ and save applicants several hours on each application as well. Our intuitive and easy-to-use workflow makes it easy and safe for borrowers to turn in and for loan officers to receive the necessary documents for lenders to make a credit decision.

That’s why we built Numero, a modern financial platform that Democratic elected officials and candidates at all levels of public office can use to manage the $4.5 billion in annual contributions to their political campaigns.

Our core product is a CRM software suite that includes a native mobile app, payment processor, referral tracker, and event management system to keep donations, pledges, and donors organized in a single place. We also just launched Electables – a grassroots fundraising platform enabling campaigns to reward their donors with unique digital collectibles. Every product we build saves our clients hours of work every week either via automation, smarter data processing, or even simply better UX. We also always build an embedded fintech component (e.g. we process payments on behalf of our clients) so that we earn revenue with every dollar our clients raise.

Our mission is to change that painful process and liberate hard-working candidates, campaign staffs, and volunteers, letting them focus on their most important work: talking with voters and representing their constituents in their communities.

For 100+ years, breath analysis (AKA metabolic testing, VO2max) has been the gold standard in anti-aging quantification, nutrition prescription, and evaluation of most critical systems, including the heart, lungs, cells, and nervous system. Until recently, it was only available in sophisticated clinics and regarded as the most valuable but underutilized assessment in medicine. PNOĒ changed that through the first easy-to-use clinical-grade breath analysis device, proprietary software package, and dedicated metabolic expert support. Through a non-invasive 10 min breath test, PNOĒ analyzes the human breath and prescribes a personalized nutrition, exercise, breathwork, and bio-optimization (i.e., red light therapy, hyperbaric chamber, IV therapy, etc.) program based on one’s biological limitations. 3,000+ health professionals trust PNOĒ because it personalizes the clients’ journey through their clinics, builds retention by quantifying progress, and enables the upsell of personalized nutrition and breathwork. All this without any effort, time commitment, or upfront cost. PNOĒ has been independently validated by Georgetown University, VA in Maryland, and Rutgers University and is trusted by leading institutions including Cenegenics, Dais Cove, MIT, UCLA, Pan Pacific, CLMBR, UCS, OURA, TONAL, Spartan Racing, and Paris Saint Germain.

By flying low on a cushion of air, seagliders unlock the ability to fly twice as far as an electric aircraft, while being regulated by maritime authorities enabling market entry for a fraction of the cost.
 
REGENT has de-risked seaglider technology with a ¼-scale, 400 lb, flying demonstration vehicle and a full-scale wing test section.

By mid-decade, REGENT’s customers - airlines and ferry companies – will begin commercial seaglider service on the 12-seat initial product.

We partner with local governments to save lives and taxpayer dollars.

More than 20 million Americans struggle with addiction, but less than 10% of people who need it receive treatment. For those that do, it usually does not work - only 8% get better. Most of this treatment is funded by governments, and goes to programs that are frequently predatory, and focus more on profit than people.

We have created an effective, accessible, and affordable solution: Recover. We offer a proven approach using medication and counseling, that can improve outcomes for over 70% of patients. It reduces overdoses by 80%, death by 50%, and has years of research and application showing it works. 

Despite how effective this medication can be, most rehabs do not have medical professionals on staff. Not only does our program work better and bring medicine to addiction care, it also costs just 10% of traditional programs.

Nick founded Recover after seeing his family and friends struggle with addiction. He was raised by a drug addict, has an alcoholic brother, and lost an uncle to heroin. He saw how hard it is for people to get the treatment they need, and how ineffective existing options are. We are working to make sure that people like Nick’s family have access to best-in-class addiction treatment so they can get and stay well.

Unlike Rent the Runway, we don’t handle any inventory or deal with cleaning the items. Our initial target market is sorority girls who can have up to 3-4 events per week that they need a new outfit/dress for. One of our core theses is that this idea couldn’t have existed at scale until now because resale apps like Depop & Poshmark paved the way for a P2P model to work after familiarizing users with the process of taking pictures of items, shipping, etc. 

Advantages to our P2P model

- Entrepreneur-led
    - Similar to Depop, most of our growth will be spearheaded by a group of “top renters”
- More variety in inventory
    - Existing rental companies like Rent the Runway own all the inventory so they're limited to the brands they buy/partner with. Since we're P2P, our users can rent any item or brand that's in someone else's closet
- Better margins
    - we don’t touch any inventory or deal with the cleaning of any items
    - Unlike Rent the Runway, we don’t handle any inventory or the cleaning of items. This means people renting out their clothing on Dressd are responsible for shipping things out & returning them in good condition

Available as Open Source & Enterprise. By implementing Vue Storefront, you will improve your overall User Experience and lift up your revenues by at least 20%. 

1. Lightning Fast
We are on a mission to improve loading times for eCommerce users, especially on mobile devices. We want to make sure, that every site using Vue Storefront will load in under 2 seconds for all users across the globe. Currently, it is their weak spot:  
a) It takes, on average, 15.3 seconds to fully load a mobile page. 
b) 75% of mobile sites take longer than 10 seconds to load.  
c) 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load. 

Loading times mean better User Experience and this leads to eCommerce users buying more, giving better conversion rates:  
a) Walmart found that for every 1-second improvement in page load time, conversions increased by 2%  
b) Increase of conversion % at each stage of the Customer Buying Journey at eCommerce based on 0.1s improvement based on Google Research (https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/future-of marketing/creativity/mobile-page-speed-data/) 

2. Fast Time To Value
Vue Storefront is the glue for headless commerce,  giving merchants the ability to connect with any eCommerce backend, any CMS, or any other 3rd party service, as we provide those APIs by default in our cloud platform.  This is saving our clients thousands of development hours. 

Also, because of the Progressive Web App features that we provide, there is no need to build native iOS or Android apps - everything is available through the web. In combination with frontend components provided out of the box, it is possible to build a new eCommerce frontend within weeks, not months. 

3. Fast content adjustments  with any Headless CMS
Headless CMS is the only way to embrace omnichannel sales, and we know it. That is why the Enterprise version of Vue Storefront delivers the API-first setup of integrations with the best Headless CMSes out-of-the-box. 

It allows business users to edit the content & publish with a no-code approach

4. Fast learning curve for developers  
We use the modern tech stack that is easily adaptable by the developer community, and what is better market proof than the popularity of our Open Source Project? We are currently the 5th most popular eCommerce framework globally and the 1st Frontend eCommerce Framework globally!

[Wyndly (YC W21)](https://www.wyndly.com) fixes allergies by training patients' bodies to ignore their allergy triggers. Frustrated allergy suffers come to us when they no longer want to deal with pills and sprays. We diagnose the patient’s unique allergy profile and create a personalized treatment plan to give the patient lifelong allergy relief. Specifically, Wyndly is increasing access to  sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for allergy care. For our patients, we're combining the convenience of telehealth and direct-to-consumer care with an exceptional patient experience that never loses the context of care.

Wyndly represents an opportunity to change allergy care forever. With 60 million Americans suffering from allergies today, and with this number doubling over the coming years, there's simply an incredible need for the convenient care Wyndly provides. 

You can read more about us in [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/wyndly-aims-to-bring-allergy-drops-to-the-masses/).

### The Wyndly Model 

At Wyndly, we believe that better connections lead to better care, and we’re committed to making both happen at every step of the patient journey. Our allergy practice allows our patients to work with expert providers to develop personalized treatment plans for long-term allergy relief using clinically proven therapies. From a patient’s initial consultation to their final treatment delivery, we want the Wyndly experience to be a breath of fresh air for allergy sufferers – truly effective allergy relief, simply and efficiently delivered.

Once we've conquered allergies, we're transforming the care model for every chronic condition. While transactional care for purchasing pills has flourished in telehealth, no one has gone after chronic care. Patients with chronic conditions are shuffled between providers, insurance, and more -- and they never feel heard. These patients deserve better, and we're going to give it to them. Wyndly is starting with allergies, but we'll expand into asthma, sleep apnea, and other conditions in the near future.

### Our values

**Compassion**: We approach all our patients and partners with an open mind and a genuine desire to be of service.

**Focus**: We do a few things very well, and are always clear about our boundaries and direction of travel.

**Courage**: We embrace ambiguity and discomfort because we know that’s how we grow.

**Progress**: We make something better every single day.

*It boils down to empathy and forward momentum in everything we do.*

### The team

Wyndly is proudly backed by Y Combinator and a leading group of angel investors and VCs. The founders are Dr. Manan Shah (Chief Medical Officer), an ear-nose-and-throat surgeon who’s a leading practitioner of telehealth in his specialty, and his cousin Aakash Shah (CEO), who led growth  engineering at SparkGift (acquired by Stockpile in 2016) and Parse.ly (acquired by Automattic in 2021).",Life's better without allergies,2,false,false,false,Healthcare,Healthcare -> Consumer Health and Wellness,1612583606,"[""Consumer Health Services"", ""Telemedicine"", ""Subscriptions""]",[],false,false,false,false,W21,Active,"[""Healthcare"", ""Consumer Health and Wellness""]","[""United States of America"", ""America / Canada"", ""Remote"", ""Fully Remote""]",Early,false,false,,false,22707

Pandai is an app that helps students get better grades in school. 

Pandai provides gamified quizzes aligned to a specific school curriculum, from which students can learn, practice, get feedback, and diagnose their weaknesses.

🔥 Why do we build this? 

In Southeast Asia, the education system is competitive and exam-oriented. 

There is a huge demand for interventions (tutors, workbooks, and extra classes) to help students perform better in school. Pandai fills the demand with a solution that is better than the alternatives.

👨‍🏫 Who We Are

The three founders are based in Malaysia and have known each other since high school, 23 years ago. 

After we graduated (from MIT & other US colleges), we started our first education company in 2007, focusing on coaching school students in STEM subjects.

We worked closely with students (many of them from underprivileged backgrounds) and saw firsthand the impact we’ve had on them. 

We then realized that with technology, we could reach more students and bring more impact. Hence, we released Pandai in 2020. 

🚀 Present & Future

Currently, we have launched in our home ground Malaysia in 2020. 

So far, 280,000 students have completed 83 million questions on Pandai, and 92% of users have seen some improvement in their academic performance. 

We plan to expand to Southeast Asia and other emerging markets, a market of 100M+ school students. Pandai is designed to be scalable, and our content (also available in English) can be mapped to other curricula from other countries.

Since their time at the fellowship, they have felt frustrated creating their second brain while shifting between apps like Roam Research, and Obsidian. These applications were burdening them to do all three tasks of capturing, organizing, and retrieving, making the cost to value ratio of setting up the second brain really high. They decided to solve this and want to shift the burden of these steps on to software, making it easier for a user to build their second brain.

- An AI-powered Virtual Dressing Room to create professional fashion photography directly from product images. Both fashion creators and other users can easily style outfits on different models.

At Protex AI, we’re on a mission to protect the industrial workforce! We’re building a proactive computer vision tool for workplace safety - empowering industrial Health and Safety (HS) teams to identify risk and danger before it becomes a problem.

🤕 The Problem:
Keeping people safe at work is extremely hard. In the U.S. alone, there were over 5,000 deaths in the workplace in 2019, mainly in the heavy industry space.

Serious workplace injuries cost U.S. businesses circa $62 Billion annually. Until now, safety has been reactive, someone has to get injured, and in some cases fatally before something is done about it.

✅ Problem Solved:
Protex AI’s platform uses privacy-preserving camera monitoring software to provide companies with an always-on guardian angel, protecting their workforce.

The platform plugs into existing CCTV infrastructure and enables HS teams to flexibly translate their document-based safety rules into the real world.

Protex AI takes these rules and autonomously audits the customer’s facility to identify areas of high risk and non-compliance.

HS teams can access this data via a reporting engine and use it in weekly safety meetings, external safety audits, insurance discussions, and legal claims.

Almost half of the medical appointments in Latin America are missed because patients simply do not show up. This ranges from missing a regular dentist check to missing an expensive MRI scan. With increasing pressure to improve access to care in developing countries, optimizing communication and coordination with patients is a key task to achieve. This is a massive problem especially in places where most people don't know how to effectively use self-service mediums (or are too busy to use them).
 
We bootstrapped the company and we are profitable. As of August 2021 we have $97K in monthly revenue from 15 clients with a CMRG of 20% in the last year. We have 100% logo retention and we grow with our clients. We are currently coordinating over 600,000 medical appointments every month, just in Chile.

This problem represents a $3.5B market opportunity in Latin America only. Latin America has 650M people, each one having an average of 3 medical consultations per year. We charge for every time we effectively communicate with a patient. We plan to handle several coordination interactions with every patient for each consultation, which considers a roadmap of scheduling, confirming, booking, reimbursements, payments, among others.

We are a team mixing strong knowledge about the healthcare industry with deep technical skills. Felipe (CEO) is a former dentist that has led deep changes in healthcare payments in Chile. Mauricio (CTO) and Jorge (R&D), both PhD in Computer Science, led the creation of the most advanced Spanish Language Neural Network used daily by scientists and practitioners in LatAm (BETO: Spanish BERT).

In a weekend project, Mauricio and Jorge automated the communication with students attending a summer school obtaining impressive engagement. Felipe was struggling with contacting his patients to coordinate appointments, and saw a big opportunity in this technology.

Our online program is 3X more effective at 1/4th the cost.

The user receives bi-weekly 1-1 coaching focused on behavioral changes, online community for support and motivation, and a mobile app that provides educational lessons, lifestyle tracking tools and weekly challenges (gamification). The content and behavioral change techniques are centred around healthy diet, fitness, lifestyle and stress reduction.

Our unique coaching methodology employs cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), goal-oriented treatment and self-efficacy enhancement. The coach helps the user bust negative emotions of past failures in weight-loss and increase motivation by linking short-term achievable goals with the user's personal values. Through the program, the user is able to self-identify triggers of unhealthy habit adoption and make better decisions.

Breathe Well-being has demonstrated success in helping people lose weight, build long-term healthy habits and reduce/eliminate medication for lifestyle diseases (example - Type 2 Diabetes).

Here’s the problem we see. Only 10% of the 100 million middle-income Indian workers have invested in the markets. This is despite the fact that they save ~30% of their income, making this a $325B potential market in assets under management.

We’re building an AI - driven investment planning software that is designed for beginners. Users use our conversational AI to get diversified mutual fund portfolios tailored to their goals. We also offer users a credit card secured by their investments, so they can earn return without losing liquidity.

And in that sense, the timing for Spenny couldn't have been better: 1 Trillion+ transactions are expected in 2021 because of factors like Whatsapp launching its P2P payments in India for its 400M users. And the emergence of UPI means every Indian has a virtual bank account now.

At the time, the average life expectancy of an American was 62. 

A lot has changed in the last 83 years. The average American now lives until 79. The people turning 65 today were 45 during the first dot-com boom. The fastest growing segment on Tik-Tok is seniors. It took 20 years, but the internet has finally arrived for seniors.

But most of the products that seniors use are distinctly “pre-web” - they’re cumbersome and exploitative.

When seniors buy healthcare, they have to talk to an insurance agent over the phone. These agents are exactly what you’d expect - they don’t know much about health insurance and they push Mom and Dad into the plan they get the highest commission on.

When seniors look to for liquidity, reverse mortgage brokers take advantage of their financial illiteracy.

When seniors look for companionship, they find themselves isolated in the suburbs they originally moved to to raise a family.

We are acutely aware of these problems because we see our own parents experience them. 

Fair Square is fixing them. 

Fair Square’s goal is to be a company seniors trust. To advise them on health insurance and financial planning. To find them a book club or an Art History lecture at a local community college. To have the customer experience of a five-star hotel and the care and respect of a relative.

We started by building a customer obsessed health insurance brokerage for seniors. We’ve worked with 10,000 people across the United States. Our NPS score is 98, compared to an industry average of 13.

We write software that understands the activity of individual cells as opposed to all cells. This approach is novel because we are no longer looking at average signals and can be precise. It is like a police person trying to identify the speeding car, they won’t find it if they look at all the cars at once, rather they need to look at the speed of each individual car. This is the beauty of single cell genomics, we can now identify that speeding car.

Why now?
The biggest barrier for entry into the single cell genomics market are cost and data analysis. To that end, we have reduced the cost by 10-fold and built the computational infrastructure for scalability. Although single cell sequencing has only been around for about five years, we come from one of the top single cell genomics labs and were the first to process and analyze millions of immune cells. Thanks to our software solutions, we have been able to bring big data solutions to the immune system.

Where are we and where are we going?
We have generated a database of over 1 million immune cells spanning healthy, cancerous, and autoimmune immune cells and are growing through paid partnerships. Harnessing out database and ML software, we can take a data-centric approach for better target discovery. Fortunately, as our database continues to grow, our models will continue to learn for more precise, unbiased, and automated single cell genomics.

Volumetric is a recognized world leader in building living multicellular tissues, with a focus on replicating discrete functions of the human body for basic mechanistic biology, laboratory testing and screening, and drug development. Founded in 2018 by Bagrat Grigoryan and Jordan Miller as a spin-out from Rice University, the full potential of our work is to build whole human organ replacements for patients, made from their own cells.

Our Technology and Approach
We have invented a suite of breakthrough 3D bioprinting technologies, featured on the cover of Science, that can build human tissue with complex blood vessel networks. We are leveraging this technology in the short term to build patient-specific tissues for drug safety and efficacy testing. Patient cells are taken from a biopsy, added to our proprietary 3D printed tissues, and then drug compounds are injected through the blood vessel network to mimic actual drug delivery in humans. Our vision is that our technology will provide rigorous, reproducible, and predictive outcomes for patients, resulting in drastically improved outcomes for diseases like cancer. More broadly, we see the full potential of our mission as being able to produce functional tissue and organ replacements for diseased or damaged vital organs in the body such as the lung, liver, pancreas, kidney, and heart.

The company was surprised to see that the simple process of accepting payments was not streamlined. So they went about building an ecosystem from scratch with a hyperfocus on making the lives of businesses simpler and that's how Razorpay was born. The company witnessed the dismal state of the online payments industry in India and understood that they have a larger and more important issue to solve - democratizing payments for Indian businesses, particularly the underserved market, the SMEs. Razorpay today powers online payments for 34 of the 42 startups in India that became unicorns in 2022. 

Razorpay enables payments and banking solutions for over 10Mn businesses, including the likes of Facebook, Airtel, Lenskart, Mirae Asset Capital markets, Indian Oil, National Pension Scheme, TataConsultancy Services, Swiggy, CRED, BookMyShow, Ola, Zomato, Swiggy, ICICI Prudential among others. The core premise of the vision and values that Razorpay was founded in 2014 is the same as the organization practices today. It is to make money movement simpler and easier. Razorpay is on the path of building the Central Nervous System of Digital India, the next-gen payments and banking infrastructure for Digital India. The company will continue building an ecosystem that will not just build intelligent products that will make the lives of businesses easy and efficient but also drive financial growth and innovation for small businesses. All this is being done, together, in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders so that India can build a better place for doing business.

Razorpay’s valuation jumped from $1 billion to $7.5 billion in just 14 month in 2021 and has added a host of marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valley’s largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator. Marquee investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and MasterCard have invested a total of $741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and F funding. The last financing round of Series F led the company’s valuation to $7.5 Billion signaling one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn. Razorpay plans to further scale up its Business Banking Suite, RazorpayX, and again build new banking solutions in 2023 that will help businesses focus less on handling compliance, operations and more on growth.

This commitment to make lives simpler will continue at a much deeper level now, thanks to the opportunity to make acquisitions with like-minded companies.  In total, till date, Razorpay has made seven acquisitions over the course of time: 

Acquired Ezetap in 2022 - India’s leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - India’s leading fintech startup that provides payments-linked loyalty solutions to payment networks, banks, and businesses, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-enabled, and cloud-ready payment solution and made its first international foray in South-East Asia by announcing its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A Recurring revenue platform. TeraFin Labs in 2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform that facilitates digital financing solutions.  RazorpayX Payroll in 2019 - a Payroll and HR Management Software company, to solve for seamless automation of a business’s entire payroll process, and Thirdwatch in 2019 - an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven company specializing in big data and machine learning for real-time fraud prevention. 

Customer has always been at the core of all disruption that the company does, from addressing evolving needs to delivering new solutions:

- This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpay’s several Industry first innovation into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first to launch completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch support for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce recurring payments for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment receipts and later automating payouts and making the entire process seamless and optimized and many more were introduced aling the way. Other firsts include:

- First to launch India’s Multi-Network Tokenisation solution, TokenHQ 
- Razorpay became India’s first payment gateway to support credit cards on UPI
- Razorpay also became India’s largest omnichannel payment gateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is India’s leading offline POS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the in-person offline payments experience. 
- Razorpay expanded health insurance policy to include LGBTQIA+ and Live-In Partners- This industry-first move made Razorpay the first Fintech unicorn in India to introduce a thoughtfully diverse and highly inclusive insurance policy for its team members. The new insurance policy, introduced recently, is applicable to all current team members of Razorpay.

Mezmo was brought to life by three-time co-founders Chris Nguyen and Lee Liu and included in the Winter 2015 batch of Y Combinator. In 2018 the company partnered with tech giant, IBM, to become the sole logging provider for IBM Cloud.

Mezmo is on a mission to empower people who build solutions that shape the world.

We’re cloud-native and know how to make the most of modern technology like Kubernetes.
We have scaled a solution from zero to petabyte scale in a short amount of time, while supporting thousands of active users across multiple environments.
We are hungry for change and are surrounded by enterprises telling us they’re hungry, too.

Still, we know that we can help them get more value from their observability data by providing more flexibility and control over how they use it. This will enable teams to spend less time switching between data silos so they can focus on shipping better, more resilient, and secure products.

We’re the only non-prescription product proven to provide long-lasting relief for the 30 million Americans who suffer from eczema.

How it works:
Skin surface pH is constantly in flux, and many of your daily activities can throw it out of balance. People with chronic skin conditions such as eczema have a harder time regulating their skin's pH. 

Soteri's patented pH/LOCK™ locks skin in at a therapeutic pH for 12+ hours, which is shown to help break the cycle of skin sensitivity, whether you have eczema, psoriasis, or just a bad sunburn.

Our formulations are aesthetically elegant (non-sticky, sit well under makeup, etc), safe for anyone to use, and don't require a prescription. Most people see skin health improvements within the first few weeks of application, even for tricky, chronic skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis.

On average, store owners buy products from over 10-15 different suppliers each week. This painful process involves shopping in massive warehouses or spending hours working with wholesaler’s sales representatives (who sometimes don’t even show up). As a result, stores waste countless hours ordering products through extremely inefficient and tedious processes. These store owners are also severely impacted by inventory shortages and revenue loss which many times results in them downsizing their business or shutting them down completely.

Attain solves this problem by providing a single app to purchase products across all of their suppliers, resulting in a one-stop shop for inventory. By aggregating inventory across a multitude of suppliers and wholesalers, Attain helps stores save significant time and money while allowing them to focus on what they do best - growing their businesses.

We're not just making collaboration faster—we're crafting it to be the best.

Today we’re all using online platforms more than ever before - building, researching, learning, connecting etc. And we're not doing it alone. We're doing it together with other people and machines, turning the internet into the world's biggest team.

Yet, the web was built for solo voyages. We saw a shift when platforms like Figma and Google Docs brought a multiplayer approach, breaking down walls and inspiring seamless teamwork.

At Velt, we're taking it further. We're on a mission to infuse the magic of collaboration into the fabric of the web—one app at a time. We aim to erase the lines between online and offline co-working, crafting an environment where distance is irrelevant, and 'flow' is the norm.

Right now, more than half of work hours are spent on coordination and communication—less on creating. With Velt, we're setting out to reverse these figures, reducing time spent on logistical issues by over 90%. Imagine what we can create when we spend less time talking about work and more time doing it!

We're building a better web—a web for us, for our team, for everyone. Join us, and let's accelerate the future of web together 🚀

Our Products:

- Velt SDK (https://velt.dev/): JS SDK to add powerful collaboration experiences to your own product for your end-users. This helps you ship such experiences ridiculously fast, increase user growth and engagement.
- Superflow (https://usesuperflow.com/): JS plugin to enable product, marketing and design teams to comment and collaborate directly on their websites. This helps them iterate and ship their products 10x faster.

Currently, we are focused on helping radiology AI teams prepare high-quality datasets to train their algorithms.

Radiology data, such as CT and X-ray scans, is an incredibly important source of truth in healthcare delivery. In fact, over 90% of all healthcare data is medical imagery! However, the global radiology workforce is overburdened. In the UK, for example, only 2% of radiology departments are able to fulfill their reporting requirements, and this trend is reflected worldwide.

The acute state of radiology, coupled with the abundance of data, makes the use of AI in radiology a prime candidate. In 2022, $5.6 billion was invested in the development of AI in healthcare! However, a key hindrance to further adoption is the lack of sophisticated tools to build and deploy AI algorithms in clinical environments. This is the problem we’re focused on at RedBrick AI.

By referencing data schemas, JumpWire labels select properties inside data payloads and transforms the raw data into a protected format, using encryption, tokenization or masking. JumpWire’s approach to securing data in-place minimizes the risk of data leaks exposing sensitive information or mishandling by other applications and vendors. The exact security scheme applied to data is defined by policies that align with an organization’s existing InfoSec program.

JumpWire helps companies who maintain information security with compliance programs such as SOC or HIPAA. They are processing sensitive data, often from their own customers, and exceed security best practices as a competitive advantage. JumpWire provides defense at depth to data and sits alongside access controls and Layer 4 encryption to provide a comprehensive data security solution.

JumpWire is unique from solutions such as data vaults by installing inside our customers’ own infrastructure and clouds. It is interoperable with existing applications and databases, which eliminates the need for large data migrations or code refactoring.

Mass produced shirts were meant to accommodate a wide variety of body types with one standard size, and different brands have different sizing standards, making shopping difficult--many men must shop in 4 - 5 different stores before finding a shirt that actually fits! By providing a home try on program and giving the ability to make custom fit adjustments to all of their apparel, Vastrm allows its customers to finally hone in on and find the perfect fit for their unique body types.

Tang came up with the idea for Vastrm, which is a Sanskrit word for cloth, when a customer told him he had purchased a perfect shirt in Italy and has never been able to find the same fit again.

We launched in India 60 days ago and have grown from 0 to 40k transacting users and hit a monthly GTV of $280K already. We are growing 25% week on week.

India is a nation of savers but the way the majority of India saves is non-smart & does not create wealth. There are 200 Mn Indians who save manually in bank deposits, the returns from these instruments do not even beat India's inflation. 

Gold is an instrument that India loves - 30Bn worth gold is purchased in India every year by middle income households. Gold has great cultural significance in India & there is high familiarity with the asset class. Despite gold being a familiar asset class & giving 5% higher returns than bank deposits, 200 Mn Indians still save manually in these non wealth creating bank deposits. This is largely because the ways to save in Gold required painful discrete activities such as manually accumulating money to buy gold, going to offline stores to buy this gold, incurring storage charges & more. The minimum ticket size for purchasing gold at these stores is $50 adding to more friction to saving in Gold.

Using automated savings, Gullak now makes it extremely easy for users to save small amounts regularly($1/day) in digital Gold.This was not possible a year ago because the underlying infrastructure(UPI Autopay) was missing. 

With 50 Mn Indians saving $2/day & with gold backed lending, this is a $1.5Bn market opportunity.

The patent-pending ALT TEX fermentation technology creates a polyester alternative that works with the existing infrastructure to supply a sustainable, high performance and cost competitive polyester replacement to fashion brands, at scale. 

The product solves key problems for fashion brands, consumers, and the environment:

(1) Fashion brands: ALT TEX sells fabric to fashion brands, allowing them to differentiate via sustainable options (sustainable fashion growing 11% CAGR) and hit sustainability targets, without sacrificing performance or changing their current supply chain.

(2) Consumer: The ALT TEX fabric is projected to be half the price vs. other specialized sustainable alternatives (due to low-cost input and scalability), meaning greater accessibility.

(3) Environment: A single shirt produced with ALT TEX fabric can divert 1 kg of food waste from landfills, 9 kg of carbon emissions from the air, and 4 g of micro-plastics from our waterways.

Co-founders Myra and Avneet have worked together managing teams and projects for six years, with backgrounds in serial entrepreneurship, corporate sales at Fortune 500 companies, textile manufacturing and biochemistry.

Fintechs use Sunlight to automatically make their cards top-of-wallet as soon as they're issued. 

Merchants, service providers and subscriptions-based businesses everywhere now offer their customers the ability to save a debit/credit card on file, so they can pay their bills on time, buy in one click, or earn rewards. In 2021, 79% of consumers worldwide reported already having at least one payment card saved with a service or being open to doing so. 

In recent years, card-issuing as-a-service has become mainstream: any company can now start their own card business in a matter of weeks. Last year, the number of new payment cards issued was at an all-time high. For users, however, switching banks or opening a new card now comes with an additional hurdle: they need to update their payment info across the internet. On the other side of that equation, card issuers have no visibility or control over the card-on-file updating process, and as a result struggle to get their new users to switch their spend from their old card to the new one, leading to low conversion rates and missed revenue opportunities.

Until Sunlight.

With our universal get-your-card-on-file API, FIs can now offer their users, at any point in their journey, a quick and easy way to update their debit/credit card info everywhere they shop or pay online, without ever leaving their Apps.

2. CustomerOS provides tooling for your in-life customer motion.  We predict renewals (and churn), provide risk-weighted ARR forecasts, and manage all your Customer Success workflows, from onboarding to expansion to advocacy.

3. CustomerOS lead scores your pipeline against your ICP.  We build data-driven profiles of your best customers and provide a real-time ICP-fit indicator on your sales and marketing pipeline.

**Team**

Yo and Misato have previously built a retail-tech company together and sold it for $20M to Rakuten. Yo is a three-time-acquired serial entrepreneur with a McKinsey background. Misato is a previous head of R&D at Mercari.
Tailor is the first YC company fully based in Japan.

**The Problem**
In today's business world, old ERP systems just don't keep up.

Their monolithic architecture makes it difficult for developers to tailor to the specific needs, even though that's what the enterprises want for ERP. 

At the same time, legacy ERPs struggle to work well with the variety of cloud-based tools that modern businesses rely on.


Legacy, monolithic systems make it very difficult to customize and hard to integrate. Every time the company wants to change something, it becomes a huge project.


Building on these challenges, users of old ERP systems often face:
* Hard-to-Use Interfaces: The screens and menus are old school... confusing, slowing down your work.
* Wrong Set of Features: Too many unnecessary options for you and not enough of what you actually need.
* Lack of Transparency: It's tough to understand what's happening behind the scenes.
* High Cost: The expense of maintaining these systems eats into your budget.



**The Solution**

Why Headless?

- With our headless product, the frontend is easy to customize for clients
- API-first approach makes it easy to connect with other existing systems or 3rd party services

What does it mean to our clients?

- Faster development
- Reduced maintenance cost
- Well-documented backend APIs

As mRNA technology matures, it becomes imperative that these issues are solved so we can fully explore mRNA's endless possibilities as a therapeutic.

Cisterna uses proprietary technologies to either remove a contaminant at its source or replace the source itself. For example, to remove double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), we use ribozymes - molecular scissors - to precisely cut the mRNA at its 3’ end. This assures not only 3’ homogeneity, but also eliminates dsRNA, which are primarily produced due to self-templated additions at the 3’ end. Utilizing a PCR-like system to amplify the DNA template in large quantities eliminates the requirement for plasmid enrichment in bacteria, the prime source of endotoxin contamination. These are just a few examples of Cisterna’s powerful technologies being used to achieve our goal of 10x higher quality mRNA for therapeutic application.",High quality mRNA for therapeutic application,2,false,false,false,Healthcare,Healthcare,1656370216,"[""Synthetic Biology"", ""Biotech"", ""Therapeutics""]",[],false,false,false,false,S22,Active,"[""Healthcare""]","[""United States of America"", ""America / Canada""]",Early,false,false,,false,26554

Coin 2.0 lets you swipe or tap your cards at millions of merchants across the USA. Coin 2.0 has 80%+ compatibility, partly because we use cutting-edge technology that has not yet been integrated into all point-of-sale systems. We encourage customers to carry a “backup card” given the wide variety of sales registers in the USA. While Coin 2.0 shares the same form factor as a credit card, it features enhancements such as an electronic display and a single button to allow for simple switching between different cards. With over-the-air updates, Coin 2.0 adapts to evolving payment technology, offering future-ready ubiquity in a small and powerful package. Coin's security features also keep your information safe. Auto-unlock means that only you can use your Coin 2.0 while Last Known Location helps you find your Coin 2.0 in case of loss or theft. Coin 2.0 is designed for use in the USA.

That’s where Oncobox comes in. Oncobox is low-cost personalized genetic profiling to help doctors decide which drug to use. In a recent study conducted by leading cancer researchers in Europe and Asia on 900 patients with various late-stage cancers, Oncobox increased the effectiveness of targeted therapies from 25% to 64%.

How does Oncobox work? Over 150 targeted cancer drugs are currently on the market. But deciding which of these drugs to give to late-stage cancer patients is not a simple task. Cancer doctors are in a race against the clock. They don’t always know which medication will be most effective for their patients. Because these drugs are expensive and typically have significant side effects, they can’t just try them all. Because of these barriers, targeted cancer therapies are effective only 25% of the time, and 70% of patients with late-stage cancers die due to the toxic side effects of ineffective drugs.

Oncobox Dx analyses tumor DNA, RNA, and molecular pathways using algorithms to distinguish which molecular targets are the most crucial for individual cases. Doctors receive a clinically actionable report that shows them which drugs are likely to be most effective on the patient.

These fabrics literally change shape in response to a change in temperature: the fabrics become thicker and insulate more as the temperature drops, and they become thinner and insulate less as the temperature rises again. This ""intelligent insulation"" has no wires or sensors, and the fabric's shape-changing behavior comes from a natural materials response. 

Skyscrape’s fabrics offer expanded thermal comfort across a wider temperature range than conventional clothing. Creating textiles that could change shape with changing temperatures required years of laboratory work by an interdisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, designers, and weavers, designing and refining machines and processes to make yarns and fabrics that could adapt to the environment.

First, we help food and mining companies cut both their heat costs *and* CO2 emissions by replacing gas-fired steam boilers with our proprietary high temperature heat pumps. Our heat pumps make up to 3x more heat with the same amount of electricity, even at up to 1000°F.

Once the heat pump market is mature, we will address the seasonal energy storage market. Our storage units are based on the exact same proprietary engine we use for our heat pumps. They work with solar and wind, and replace lithium-ion batteries, fossil-fired power plants, CO2 capture and storage, and fuel procurement, with a cheaper, sustainable and more reliable alternative, which can be sited anywhere.

The first opportunity is a high-margin market worth 3% of worldwide CO2. The second is a much bigger market worth 30% of worldwide CO2. By the time all cars become electric, it will be even more.

Our key is we are building the first Stirling engine to reach 86% of the Carnot efficiency, compared to 64% for the state of the art. We do all that while significantly decreasing costs, and increasing reliability.

To get there, we’re taking a different approach than most. We're applying our technologies to every industry where autonomous electric aircraft can be useful, starting with the highest value and most dangerous jobs. In doing so, we're building game-changing products manufactured at scale, while perfecting the safety, reliability, and capabilities of our autonomy engine and electric propulsion systems. 

We design, develop and manufacture an ecosystem of technologies including proprietary flight control software, avionics, high power density motors, motor controllers, batteries, and custom carbon-fiber composite airframes.

Today, we supply autonomous electric aircraft for cargo transport and crop protection to real-world customers across four separate continents and have secured industry-first regulatory approvals from the FAA. 

Our cargo aircraft enables remote connectivity, enhances express delivery networks, and ensures fast and reliable shipping of critical supplies to areas in need. Our crop protection aircraft offers agricultural services providers and farmers an autonomous tool to make aerial application safer, more precise, and less harmful to surrounding environments. Both vehicles are highly economical to operate, easy to deploy, and significantly reduce C02 emissions in their respective industries.

Traveling? Earn some extra cash.
Let backpack help you save that high shipping cost or earn a little extra.

Backpack is a peer-to-peer platform that connects travelers and shoppers to give people access to products across markets in all continents. 
Each backpacker, regardless of their role as a carrier or a shopper, follows a simple four-step process to either earn or save money from their backpacking experience.
Travelers share their travel information and specify what kind of items they want to carry. Then they wait to get a ""backpack request"" and ask their price. Finally, they confirm the deal, buy the items, deliver them and earn money. Shoppers on the other hand, search items from their favorite websites and fill out the item description. Then they give their location and find a traveler coming to their city. Finally they ""request backpack"" and confirm the deal. Within days they can get the product and save money.  

backpack is founded with a vision to provide every citizen of the world with a choice; the choice of buying organic, authentic, and cost effective products with minimum friction.

Nearly 3 out of 4 millennials would rather go to the dentist than listen to their bank. While it's possible that we just really love our oral hygiene, it's more likely that we don't trust or like our banks.

It's not hard to understand why. Big banks use big budgets and armies of salespeople and marketers to sell old-school products layered with fees and penalties. Their profits increase when we spend more, overuse debt, and make mistakes like overdrafting.

Big banks get away with this because banking is such a vital service. Everyday spending and saving decisions that begin at the checking account ultimately determine whether we'll lead a healthy and secure financial life.

At the same it's very painful for a DevOps engineer to wake up at midnight and on weekends to deal with server and application alerts. 

Enter Neptune, which lets a DevOps engineer automate his incident response steps --Troubleshooting + Resolution + Documentation,  so that he/she can fix the incidents in minutes instead of hours. So it's a win-win deal : For businesses downtime is minimized, and for DevOps engineers they need not worry about a deluge of alerts and midnight wake up calls.

Today, mental health disorders are one of the leading causes of death worldwide, especially among young adults, and are tied to shortening lifespans. While there have been developments in new psychiatric medications since the first FDA approval in 1954, today there is a growing movement among clinicians, patients, and researchers who are recognizing the need to accelerate new science.

The Osmind treatment platform is the first and only solution that solves specific challenges faced by neuropsychiatric clinics, spanning general psychiatry and interventional psychiatry (transcranial magnetic stimulation, ketamine, SPRAVATO®, psychedelic medicine, electroconvulsive therapy). The core electronic health record (EHR) technology is precisely developed for interventional treatment workflows and designed to support a strong therapeutic alliance, including journaling tools and assistance with health plan reimbursement, which is a significant access hurdle for millions of patients.

Research from our platform is already helping to set new standards for mental health interventions. For example, in the largest published real-world analysis of ketamine infusion therapy for depression, we teamed up with Stanford University School of Medicine to share findings in the Journal of Affective Disorders (March 2022). We have multiple ongoing research studies leveraging our proprietary real-world data, including an even larger ketamine analysis leveraging machine learning to predict treatment outcomes.

Our Philosophy:

1. Hyper-personalisation is the future.
2. User experience in healthcare is flawed.
3. Service providers (not just doctors) should care about health outcomes. 

We believe there are two kinds of industries that are ripe for disruption: the first is where there is an opportunity to reform, it's not user-friendly, and there is a distinct lack of trust. The second is where there are a lot of uneven profit margins being distributed, where a few companies are making a lot of money, they have high-profit margins and yet, customers are unhappy.

Healthcare in India, unfortunately, belongs to both of these buckets. And this is the reason why there are many new venture-funded companies trying to bring reform to this sector using various attack vectors.

There are three reasons why we feel healthcare in India is ripe for disruption:

1. Size: Over 200B is lost in income every year because of NCD-related loss in productivity.
2. Efficiency: The industry is inefficient and has built-in redundancies.
3. Experience: Other industries have become responsive and consumer-focused (Retail>E-Commerce) whereas healthcare has always lagged behind.

The way healthcare is being delivered is changing, with patients treated less often in hospitals and more as outpatients, while payers are moving towards a system that reimburses providers for helping reduce the cost of care overall.

At Medpiper, we are working with insurance companies to build a platform where end users can access healthcare goods and services and meaningfully connect with the local brick-and-mortar healthcare vendors by being a one-stop shop for everything from telehealth and diagnostics, chronic disease management to medical devices and actual drug supplies. Our aim is to improve long-term population health outcomes by providing personalized healthcare and a seamless user experience while at the same time maintaining quality and price transparency.",Enabling insurers with medical underwriting suite,22,false,false,false,Healthcare,Healthcare -> Healthcare IT,1597677447,"[""Marketplace"", ""B2B"", ""Healthcare"", ""Health Insurance"", ""Insurance""]",[],false,false,false,false,S20,Active,"[""Healthcare"", ""Healthcare IT""]","[""India"", ""South Asia"", ""Remote"", ""Partly Remote""]",Early,false,false,,false,22196

Local ISPs connect more than 50 million U.S. homes to the internet today, but their businesses typically run on a mess of legacy systems, and as a result, they struggle to work effectively, and usually fail to deliver great subscriber experience.

With Ready, local ISPs get everything they need to deliver seamless subscriber experience – from finding & signing prospects in their geographic area, to onboarding and billing, to integrations with legacy data systems – all in one place.

If you’re looking for meaningful, rewarding experience, there are many reasons to consider joining Ready for your next chapter, including:
* **Constant engagement**: large product surface area means there’s never a shortage of interesting, challenging, meaningful problems to solve.
* Team motto is “**builders building**”: We strongly prefer shipping results to customers over heavy processes and lots of meetings.
* Experienced founders and a culture of sharing mean there are plenty of opportunities to **learn all about building startups**, not just coding.
* Aspects of the product are customer-facing enterprise tools, other aspects face the subscriber, a rare combo of **B2B** and **B2B2C**.
* **Remote team**: work anywhere you want, as long as you get strong internet (and the platform we’re making helps make that true in more places).
* We’re well funded, and place strong emphasis on **revenue from customers** – our ambition is to build a large and important company with many options down the road and **minimal dilution** along the way.

Today, fuel is the main cost component for logistics operators, accounting for >1/3 of all operating costs. Driving behavior is a key factor affecting overall fuel consumption and can increase fuel use by up to 35%. However, current solutions are not cost effective, so logistics operators are constantly looking for new solutions. 

In addition, logistics operators are under huge sustainability pressure, as Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) are responsible for 16% of the UK's transport emissions but only 5% of the miles travelled. While electric vehicle sales for passenger vehicles are on the rise, the same can't be said for long-haul HGVs due to high initial cost and limited range, making it impractical for logistic purposes. 

With this problem in mind, we aim to leverage the latest AI techniques to improve the fuel efficiency of diesel trucks today, and increase the range of zero-emission trucks of the future. 

Our product Hypermile Co-Pilot is a retrofittable AI cruise control for commercial vehicles focused on controlling the speed of the truck efficiently. We have trained the AI algorithms to learn the best techniques for saving fuel: anticipating how traffic flow will change, optimising speed based on the road gradient and maximizing vehicle coasting. As a result, we can reduce diesel consumption by 11% and extend the range of battery-electric vehicles by 15%. The long term vision is to incrementally build higher levels of autonomy with the next milestone being a Level-3 autonomous trucking solution. 

The company was founded in May 2020 and raised a $1.5M pre-seed round in May 2021 from Y Combinator, Greg Brockman (CTO of OpenAI), Luc Vincent (former Executive VP of Autonomous Driving at Lyft Level 5) and others. We’ve received a number of R&D grants from Innovate UK, Department for Transport and Horizons 2020.

Online security was only becoming more important, but we knew firsthand how hard it could be for fast-growing companies to invest the time and manpower it takes to build a solid security foundation.

From our early days of automating security monitoring for compliance standards like SOC 2, HIPAA, and ISO 27001, to pioneering a brand-new market as the leading Trust Management Platform, our vision to restore trust in internet businesses by enabling companies to improve and prove their security remains unchanged. Now more than ever, making security continuous—not just a point-in-time check— is essential. Vanta is the leading Trust Management Platform that helps simplify and centralize security for organizations of all sizes. Over 4,000 companies including Autodesk, Chili Piper, Flo Health and Quora, rely on Vanta to build, maintain and demonstrate their trust—all in a way that's real-time and transparent.

Mighty Buildings' technology has the potential to unlock the needed productivity for large scale construction alongside the opportunity for reduced emissions, leading to a more sustainable product and future.

The leading gum is sold like a pharmaceutical drug, with flavoring and packaging to match. Vapes provide a cumbersome, over-the-top experience — with use as tightly restricted as cigarette smoking itself, but more juvenile, conspicuous, and highly addictive. People want, and deserve, a better way.

Therefore, we want to deliver nicotine users a superior experience, and at the same time give them a way to transition out of feeling dependent. In a better society, people wouldn’t carry around the sensation that they’re stuck with an involuntary habit. Our mission isn’t to encourage nicotine use among people who haven’t started. Unlike certain vapes or other products, ours isn’t the sort coveted by underage users on social media. Our mission is to alleviate the harm related to tobacco — first and foremost, by switching people away from the most harmful products.

So, at Lucy, we take an evidence based view of nicotine. Nicotine’s pleasurable properties make it an inevitable part of modern society. Therefore, minimizing harm in all nicotine products is key, in addition to giving people products and strategies for cessation. We feel that, as 1,300 people are dying of tobacco related illnesses every day in the US, the most important and immediate step toward a better society is giving nicotine consumers products they enjoy using that will cause less harm.

Our first product is designed to appeal to smokers and encourage them to switch. And, looking ahead, we hope to secure approval in the future as a clinically proven smoking cessation aid, while continuing to participate in the FDA’s public hearings around how NRTs are best regulated. Our goals are simple: because harm reduction is a better strategy around nicotine delivery than abstinence or prohibition, we want to help improve public health — and reduce its costs — through a superior pure nicotine product.",Lucy’s mission is to reduce tobacco-related harm to zero.

The result of countless sleepless nights, numerous rolls of duct tape, a few everyday household objects, far too many takeouts and some epic battles with a kitten... it was released into an unsuspecting world at the entirely inappropriate time of 2am on New Year's Eve.

Soon one app become four, and before we knew it we had lots of happy users and lots of great coverage by all sorts of people such The Telegraph, Wired, O'Reilly and MacFormat. Being a friendly bunch, we took the time to chat with the hundreds of you who said hello, and we found you all had the same problem: gyms were either too expensive, too daunting, too boring or too inconvenient. In other words, a lot of people needed another way to stay active.

And the more people we spoke to, the bigger this problem seemed to be - it was like almost no one was active enough! Big problems require big solutions, so after raising some money from the visionaries at 4iP we amassed a team of the best designers, artists, 3d animators and programmers with the single mission: to improve the fu of the world by making an app so damn good that everyone will want to stay active.

Fitfu allows you to:

* Track your motion

Using the accelerometer on your iPhone or iPod Touch, FitFu gives you feedback to help you keep going and reach your goals.

* Celebrate progress with friends

Friends are the key to sticking to your goals, so we've made FitFu social; whether you want to cheer them on, thank them for help or just compare your progress.

* Discover a new way to stay motivated

The more you and your friends are active, the higher your level and the higher your points. And points mean prizes; unlock new content as you progress.

* Stay active wherever, whenever

No more being tied to a games console or a gym, now you can stay active wherever you are - be that your bedroom, your office, a hotel room or in the cabin of your Mississippi boat. (Yes it happens!)

*Lose what you want
